# app-angular  
This modules contains angular web application, based on kotlin multi-platform idea it uses packages delivered from kotlin based modules packaged as NPM packages.  
  
## Prerequisites 
 
After acquiring a copy of this app, the first thing to do is to install [Node v8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  or above (Everything depends on it). After Node installation, install angular CLI.   
Finally,change working directory to app-angular and install all dependencies used in the project since node_modules directory is git ignored.   
  
* Installing Angular CLI  

```  
npm install -g @angular/cli  
```  
* Resolving EACCES Permission errors

If using Linux or MacOS, you need to change your npm global directory as per [Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)   
otherwise you will have file permission errors on build.  

* Install protractor globally

```  
 npm install protractor -g  
``` 
  
This will install protractor and webdriver-manager, then run 

 ``` 
webdriver-manager update 
```

## Development   
While you are still in app-angular , you can now build this module. It will create modules dependencies from core source ready to be installed.  
  
* Building and installing  

```  
./gradlew app-angular:build  
```  
  
After that your IDE should see all the module dependencies and should be used like this:  

```
import entity from 'UstadMobile-lib-database-entities';  
  
//it can be used by specifying full path to the class or object  
i.e  
const contentEntry = new entity.com.ustadmobile.lib.db.entities.ContentEntry();  
```  

* Run app locally

**Run with default locale**

```
ng serve  or  npm run start
```

**Running app locally for a specific locale**


```  
npm run start:<locale code> 

//i.e npm run start:en
``` 

This will create an app, to run it use http://localhost:4200/ 

**NOTE:**

Make sure you build and run development server before executing above command, to run the server in development mode use:-

```  
./gradlew app-ktor-server:appRunDevMode
```


### Codding pattern
#### Adding new component
To add new component, just run the following angular CLI commands:-

```  
ng generate component <path to views dir> <component name>
i.e ng g c com/ustadmobile/view/new-component-name
``` 

#### Adding new routes

After adding the component to the src, then after you have to create 
it's route in **src/app/app-routing.module.ts**. All routes descends from **Home** 
route so to achieve that follow the following steps.

* Go into **src/app/app.module.ts**
* Under **declarations** add your component name and make sure you add missing import
``` 
i.e  
import { NewComponentNameComponent } from "./com/ustadmobile/view/new-component-name/NewComponentNameComponent";
```
* Go into **src/app/app-routing.module.ts**.
* Under **Home** as root route, look for **children** array
* Add new route object item
``` 
 {path: "<path name>", component: <component name>}
 i.e
 {path: "newPath", component: NewComponentNameComponent}
 //This will be resolved to Home/newPath
```
* If you want to add new root routes like **Home** or **NotFound**, just place route object below either of the two.

For more information on router, routes and navigation checkout [here](https://angular.io/guide/router)

#### RTL Support
MaterializeCss doesn't support RTL out of the box, so in case you want to add new component to the app then follow the following procedure:

* In the new component constructor check if the UI is RTL or LTR, this will return **true** if the current directionality is LTR **false** otherwise
``` 
this.umService.isLTRDirectionality();
```

* Make use of Materialize quick floats, **right/left** to position the view base on the active directionality i.e.
``` 
element1_class =  this.umService.isLTRDirectionality ? "right":"left";
element2_class =  this.umService.isLTRDirectionality ? "left":"right";
```
* Use created variable to add a class to the HTML containers (div), container's will interchange position based on the current system directionality.
```
<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 l4 {{element1_class}}">Left Column</div>
    <div class="col s12 l8 {{element2_class}}">Right Column</div>
</div>
```

## Testing  
You may opt to use angular or gradle tasks to run end to end tests  with Protractor,
 for Karma it is more preferable to use gradle tasks.

* Angular test framework

With angular testing framework, don't forget to run development server

i.e
```  
./gradlew app-ktor-server:appRunDevMode
``` 
Then, you are good to start angular test

```  
ng e2e

//In-case you need to specify a port
ng e2e --port <port number>
```
* Gradle tasks

With this, you don't have to start development server since it will be started when needed and shut-down when done with testing.

  
```  
./gradlew app-angular:ngTest -Ptestmodule=e2e 

//specify port if needed, otherwise test will use default angulat port i.e 4200
./gradlew app-angular:ngTest -Ptestmodule=e2e -Ptestport=<port number>
```
To execute component tests with Karma use:-
```  
./gradlew app-angular:ngTest -Ptestmodule=<component name>  

i.e
./gradlew app-angular:ngTest -Ptestmodule=home
```
## Deployment  
To create production app, you need to generate JS bundles from angular source. To achieve that run the following command on your terminal.  

**Deploy for specific locale**

```  
npm run build:<locale code> 
//i.d npm run build:en

or 

./gradlew app-angular:buildProd -Plocale=en
```

**Deploy for all locales**

```  
npm run build-prod 

or

./gradlew app-angular:buildProd

//In case it will be deployed on a specific directory then add base href

./gradlew app-angular:buildProd -PbaseHref=<Directory name>
```
