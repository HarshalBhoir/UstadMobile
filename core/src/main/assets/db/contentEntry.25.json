The concept of ISFs was developed by PROLINNOVA (Promoting Local Innovation in ecologically-oriented agriculture and natural resource management), a nine-country programme, and the note also discusses how the PROLINNOVA partners, one of which was Cambodia, envisaged ISFs operating. The note is IK Notes no.85, one of a series of notes which report periodically on Indigenous Knowledge (IK) initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa and occasionally elsewhere.
