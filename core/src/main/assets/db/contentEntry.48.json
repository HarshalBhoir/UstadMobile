It is a three and three-quarters (sanjo daime) mat room. It is complete with an alcove for the display of a scroll and flowers, an electric-powered sunken hearth used in winter for the hot water kettle, and a functioning preparation area (mizuya) with fresh running water and drain. Its three interior ceiling levels display three different ceiling treatments.  The teahouse has a sliding glass front that opens fully when in use for live tea demonstrations, but secures the space as a display case when not in use. It was constructed in Kyoto by the distinguished firm Nakamura Sotoji Komuten, long famous for refined traditional Japanese architecture built by specially trained, artisan carpenters and craftsmen. In September 2002, the teahouse was installed in the museum’s second-floor collections gallery devoted to Japanese art. Four carpenters came from Kyoto to construct the teahouse and apply the final wall finishes.

The Barong is a protective deity that can take on a variety of animal forms--lions, tigers, and boars are some of the more common images—and each one is addressed using a respectful title such as Great God or Great Lord. Many villages, especially in southern Bali, have their own Barong figure.

It simultaneously suggests the knotted tension of anxiety and the sublime absorption of deep prayer. Created over 700 years ago, in the Inland Niger Delta region of present-day Mali, this elegant work\u0027s intense emotional immediacy blurs the boundaries of time and place. This terracotta sculpture comes from a site called Jenne-jeno, the oldest known city in sub-Saharan Africa. Jenne-jeno flourished in the ninth century C.E., but declined and was abandoned by 1400. Items of cast brass and forged iron, clay vessels, and figures like this one survive. They testify to what scholars contend was a richly varied and highly sophisticated urban society.\n\nA few controlled archaeological digs provide only the vaguest outlines of the original significance of the art of this time and region. Recovered terracotta figures are frequently quite detailed. They include jewelry, clothing, and body ornaments such as the parallel columns of bumps and circles on the back of this work. Sometimes they cover the entire body and seem to represent the pustules of some dreadful illness. Sculptures like this one may represent ancestors or mythic characters, or might have served as guardians. Here, the figure\u0027s shaved head and attitude of introspection resemble mourning customs still practiced by many cultures in sub-Saharan Africa. It is possible that the earlier peoples of the Inland Niger Delta had similar ritual methods to express grief over the death of loved ones.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Found primarily on Ambrym, Malekula, and neighboring islands, they are carved from the trunks of breadfruit trees, which are also an important food source. In each village, a number of gongs, comprising a sort of informal orchestra, stand on the village dancing ground. Gong orchestras are played at major social and religious events such as initiations, funerals, and dances. When playing, the musician stands in front of the gong and strikes the lip of the slit with a clublike wooden beater. As the gong ensemble is played, rhythms of immense variety and complexity can be produced by the carefully coordinated actions of multiple drummers.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

The Earth that we know today, the relatively peaceful home of myriad forms of life, didn’t appear overnight. Rather, it took billions of years to slowly evolve into its current form. The process of accretion that led to the formation of the Earth was a violent one, and it produced an Earth that was only a little less violent and hostile. For a few hundred million years, the early Earth was characterized by high temperatures, toxic gases, high levels of radiation, and ongoing high-impact collisions. Over time, these conditions improved and the Earth took on its distinctive structure with differentiated layers of core, mantle, crust, and atmosphere. This distinctive structure has important consequences: First, it helps explain why the surface of the Earth changes over time; and second, it helps explain why the Earth evolved into a suitable setting for living things.

Planets, which formed from clouds of chemicals created during the death of stars, are more chemically diverse than the stars from which they came. Planets also differ from stars because they don’t generate huge amounts of energy at their centers. As a result, their surface temperatures are much cooler. This combination of diverse chemical ingredients and less violent conditions enabled planets to become the setting for life. When life emerged on Earth, it had characteristics that made it very different from nonliving things. Many people will tell you they “know” the difference between living and nonliving things. However, biologists – the experts – have struggled to agree on a single definition of life, even though many of the proposed definitions share similarities.

In a process known as plate tectonics, the heat and movement of the mantle floating under the Earth’s crust drive the movement of the Earth’s crust over its surface.

Man: virtual autopsy, exploring a natural mummy from early Egypt","description":"This man died more than five thousand years ago and was buried at the site of Gebelein, in Upper Egypt. The reconstruction of his grave illustrates the early Egyptian custom of placing the body in a contracted, foetal position, usually on the left side, with the head to the south, facing the west, the land of the dead where he would be reborn. Around him were all the things he might need for his afterlife, especially pottery to hold and serve food.\nBefore the pharaohs\n\nIn the Predynastic period (4400-3100 B.C.E.), the time before the pharaohs, the dead were buried in shallow graves cut into the desert sand. The graves were often lined with reed mats, making them like a bed, and the body was covered with linen or skins and more mats, like a blanket, before the grave was refilled and perhaps topped by a mound of dirt. Contact with the hot dry sand naturally preserved the bodies because the sand absorbed the water that constitutes approximately 75% by weight of the human body. Bacteria cannot breed without moisture and as a result, the bodies frequently did not decay, but simply dried out. The body of this man is remarkably well-preserved, even down to his finger-nails and hair, which has probably faded with time.\n\nChance discoveries of these sand-dried mummies (for example, when a grave was disturbed by animals or robbers), may have promoted the belief that physical preservation of the body was necessary for the afterlife. This may have led the later Egyptians to develop means of artificial mummification after the introduction of coffins and deeper graves separated the body from the natural drying effects of the sand.\n\nThe objects that surrounded Gebelein Man in his original burial are unknown. On display is a selection of typical grave-goods from other graves of the middle Predynastic period (about 3500 B.C.E.), the time we believe he died. Attempts to date the body using Carbon 14 (the radiocarbon method) have so far been unsuccessful.\nHe has been in the British Museum collection for over 100 years, but it was not until 2012 that he was CT scanned for the first time. Detailed images created from the CT scans\u0027 high resolution X-rays are allowing us to look inside his body and learn about his life and his death in ways never before possible. © Trustees of the British Museum","entryId":"virtual-autopsy","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x05431aff","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/hbFYyDEUCkWNpTczzpoBZimgM41bHRb08_tuZ3sBOB7P2d5xtrdcpBhDoeIl-mR9-Q10PDgNuKvbDdlwVBAvXHhe","lastModified":1548921422256,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21792,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533692127,"title":"An introduction to Benjamin Franklin","description":"In this video, Sal and Aspen Institute President and CEO Walter Isaacson present an overview of Benjamin Franklin\u0027s life. ","entryId":"franklin-overview","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xd428285e","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/iHbSCyOfP59ylAR2o2L7Q1w6Nqiozr4XGUk9yl2lraWCBRYdf6mx8w47yk_qBoRP1pcYUmEJSu0IqnBW3eUCRqFk","lastModified":1548921422519,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21793,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533692126,"title":"Darwin, Evolution, and Faith","description":"","entryId":"darwin-evolution-and-faith","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x1fdf10e0","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921422557,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21794,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533692125,"title":"Aksum","description":"Aksum was the name of a city and a kingdom which is essentially modern-day northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.

For a long time, humans met their energy needs almost exclusively by eating the food they foraged in their local environment. In other words, humans were completely dependent on the plants and animals that nature provided. The invention of farming about 12,000 years ago gave humans access to vast new food and energy resources, which helped to dramatically transform the way humans lived. Among other things, farming made possible dramatic population growth, and it allowed humans to settle in larger, denser communities than a foraging lifestyle could support. These larger and denser communities eventually led to the development of cities and civilizations, which accelerated collective learning and innovation.

However, have you ever seen dogs teach one another tricks? They might mimic each other’s behavior, but that’s really not the same thing. Humans, on the other hand, can deliberately pass information to each other and teach one another new skills. This makes it much easier for each generation to pick up where the previous one left off, and it’s why we are the only species able to dominate the biosphere. But why have humans evolved into such a powerful species? What makes us special? Here the story continues, as our ancestors evolve from early Homo sapiens to more intelligent beings who are able to learn collectively. Collective learning is the foundation on which modern society is built, and the reason our species continues to build upon what previous generations created.","entryId":"how-did-first-humans-live","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/early-humans#how-did-first-humans-live","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921440896,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21905,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533692013,"title":"How Did The First Humans Live?","description":"The evidence left behind by early humans gives us a vivid picture of their lives.","entryId":"bhp-how-did-first-humans-live","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x88f59dea","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Mb3dNo4HSpzJDZz_rZXYeXcMLMXiJLoFkGY-2g_aa8Z307hW6ddSlgZpUZsNNEMsFEgz0XaO4EgAKRwZg-_YiC3O","lastModified":1548921441214,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21907,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533692012,"title":"Why Was Agriculture So Important?

Over time, these zones slowly became more connected as networks of communication and exchange expanded. While innovations did occur throughout this era, such as irrigation, iron plows, and fast-ripening rice, none of these innovations were able to sustain long-term population growth, which limited expansion. Each innovation led to immediate growth, but once populations had grown beyond a certain point, they fell. These cycles of rise and fall in population, called Malthusian cycles, characterized the agrarian era. Humans would not break out of these cycles until the world zones became more connected and rates of innovation were capable of sustaining growth over much longer periods of time.","entryId":"expansion","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/expansion-interconnection#expansion","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921449038,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":21940,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691978,"title":"7.2—Ways of Knowing: Agriculture and Civilization","description":"The mysterious pyramids of Ancient Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the beauty of Machu Picchu (an old Incan city in Peru) are all impressive remnants left behind from some of the world’s ancient agrarian civilizations. But not every civilization has left behind such noticeable clues. In fact, many artifacts from agrarian civilizations fade away with time. But the clues that remain become important windows to the past. Researchers in a variety of disciplines such as history and archaeology use both written record and historical artifacts to pose, analyze, and answer questions about the past. As you will see, written record is of particular importance. Unlike other species, writing gives us the ability to preserve and pass on large amounts of information from one generation to the next.

The voyages of Christopher Columbus extended this exchange from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, which saw a massive movement of ideas, people, diseases, plants, and animals between the two hemispheres. The results of these exchanges were dramatic. Potatoes and corn, first cultivated in the Americas, quickly became crucial in the diets of people across Eurasia. Horses and cattle, unknown in the New World in 1492, quickly took on crucial roles in many societies in the Americas.

The world, in effect, was divided into four unconnected regions, none of which was really interested in the others. With the improved transportation and communication technologies developed 500 years ago, humans acquired the means for connecting these formerly independent zones. After 1492, for example, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were put in regular contact, and the Columbian Exchange saw the transfer of people, ideas, animals, plants, and diseases between these two once separate world zones. Exchanges like these fueled social, political, economic, and intellectual innovation. Within a few hundred years, this more fully connected world saw dramatic acceleration in innovation and population growth, which ushered in the Modern Revolution.

Whether you look at temperature, types of vegetation, soils, or sea level, the basic characteristics of the biosphere have remained about the same, having shown only moderate variation at any point within most of that time frame. That type of consistency is what prompted geologists to label the last 10,000 years of geological history as the Holocene Epoch; an epoch that was ushered in at the end of the last ice age. But there are now a number of scientists who view the data from the last 250 years and conclude that the biosphere is showing fundamentally different characteristics from the previous 10,000 years. The rise of carbon dioxide levels, glacial melting, and the shrinking of tropical rainforests are just some of the factors that they cite as evidence that the biosphere has entered a new epoch. Because so much of the change they have identified seems to derive from human activity, these scientists propose that this new epoch be called the Anthropocene to reflect the tremendous impact that humans now exert in the biosphere.

No one discipline can know all there is to know about absolutely everything. It would be impossible to think of all the questions to ask, let alone have all the answers. Usually, if we look at any single object or event from the points of view of multiple areas of expertise, we can put together a rich understanding that goes far beyond a one-discipline approach.","entryId":"what-are-disciplines","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/what-is-big-history#what-are-disciplines","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921472679,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22072,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691847,"title":"Gallery: The Modern World","description":"","entryId":"gallery-the-modern-world","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe1797dd3","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921472679,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22072,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691846,"title":"Ancient Rome","description":"The Roman empire was so large that five departments of the British Museum hold art and artefacts from it.

This world is very different from the world of 500 or 1,000 years ago, let alone 10,000 or 100,000 years ago. The connection of the four world zones allowed for the creation of a global network of exchange. Though this network was not built overnight, it emerged fairly quickly, and it increased the potential connections and diversity of connections for many members of the network. The result was an acceleration of both collective learning and innovation. Commerce was an important driver of change in this global network. Because commerce began to take on greater significance for many societies, a number of important thinkers began to ask questions about the nature of the exchange of goods, the nature of productivity and efficiency, and the interests of the individual and the state in business. All of this new inquiry gave birth to the discipline of economics. These economic thinkers, like the thinkers in any discipline, shared a set of concerns and questions but often came up with very different answers to those questions. The articulation of the ideas of capitalism and communism were the most influential economic ideas generated in the course of the Modern Revolution.

The relic would have been held in a cavity at the back of the reliquary but it is no longer contained inside. There is no record of relics being contained inside the reliquary beyond 1871.\n\nSt Baudime’s reliquary has a turbulent history – the gemstones which were once studded all over his vestments were likely removed during the French Revolution in the 1790s. The reliquary was also stolen at the beginning of the 20th century by a notorious art thief. It was found soon after by police, apparently languishing in a wine cellar.\n\nWe might normally expect this type of reliquary (known as a ‘speaking reliquary’) to contain a skull – as the form of the reliquary would literally speak its contents. However, there is no record of this container ever having held a skull relic, which further adds to the object’s mystery. © Trustees of the British Museum\n","entryId":"st-baudime","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x6da80171","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/_sojRknqP2QoVq4YMgLgacjhKJKvs-sQIsw15t9JgBakV7qiUwxt4g4heV9Ws-Encol9cElBlDQswKw5j3If5XY","lastModified":1548921479252,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22115,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691804,"title":"Video Transcripts","description":"","entryId":"video-transcripts-9","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x9e7ee2df","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921479510,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22116,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691803,"title":"Web Links","description":"","entryId":"web-links-1","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x3e2e7b02","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921479565,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22117,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691802,"title":"Resources","description":"Download the teacher resources from the Big History Project classroom version of this course.

It would be impossible for any history course to cover everything related to its subject matter, and this challenge is particularly great in Big History because of the scales of time and size involved. Big History deals with this challenge by focusing on the eight turning points, or thresholds, over the course of the 13.8 billion-year story. At each of these thresholds, the Universe became more complex, and things appeared with significant new emergent properties. In this lesson, you’ll review what you’ve learned about this story, which will put you in the perfect position to think about the future of Big History in subsequent lessons in this unit.

The biosphere changes as a result of astronomical, geological, and biological influences. The dinosaurs, for example, became extinct as a result of an astronomical event—the effects of an asteroid impact on Earth. Every species impacts the biosphere, though the extent of that impact can vary dramatically. The impact of humans has changed over time. The impact of foragers was not dramatic, but these early humans did have the ability to destroy flora and fauna and cause fires in different parts of the Earth. Agriculture, and later the modern revolution, significantly increased the impact of humans on the biosphere. The acceleration of the last 100 years has seen an acceleration of these human impacts on the biosphere. What are the most significant of these impacts and what should humans be doing about them?

Why did it happen? What lessons can be drawn from these events? Studying the past is possible because there is lots of interesting evidence left behind for scholars of many disciplines—not just historians—to look at. Physicists, for example, can look at the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Universe today and draw conclusions about the early history of the Universe. Geologists can look at the distribution of plants and animals and rock formations on the Earth today and draw conclusions about the how the configuration of the Earth’s continents has changed over time. Each discipline has its own questions and evidence and is interested in investigating change over time. Historians don’t typically predict the future, but given the number of trends you’ve studied in this course, it seems appropriate to give some thought to what the future might be like.","entryId":"looking-forward","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/future#looking-forward","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921489954,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22170,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691749,"title":"Ancient glass at the Getty","description":"","entryId":"ancient-glass-at-the-getty","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x83277959","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921490044,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22171,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691748,"title":"Powell on the Second Gulf War","description":"Post 9/11 diplomacy and how the United States came to the conclusion to take military action in Iraq.

Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God\u0027s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent\u0027s wiles.\n\nIn 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.\n\nThe exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project.

Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God\u0027s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent\u0027s wiles.\n\nIn 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.\n\nThe exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project. It also inaugurates a new permanent gallery for Venetian and northern Italian sculpture. The installation of this gallery was made possible by Assunta Sommella Peluso, Ignazio Peluso, Ada Peluso, and Romano I.

This example is the oldest of the three extant pianos by Cristofori. About 1700 he began to work on an instrument on which the player could achieve changes in loudness solely by changing the force with which the keys were struck. By 1700 he had made at least one successful instrument, which he called \"gravicembalo col piano e forte\" (harpsichord with soft and loud). His instrument still generally resembles a harpsichord, though its case is thicker and the quill mechanism has been replaced by a hammer mechanism. Cristofori\u0027s hammer mechanism is so well designed and made that no other of comparable sensitivity and reliability was devised for another seventy-five years. In fact, the highly complex action of the modern piano may be traced directly to his original conception.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"phenomenon","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x4832d4b2","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZZV3N2xhr8oR8AEMd3uYvobBPSCqQ1oaSBiZjD5l_gTNvC4GwdMDwGrWB92k_reEbfsBr9bwMO-HCY90AHr0iLU","lastModified":1548921516980,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22345,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691570,"title":"Shitao, Returning Home","description":"Met curator Joseph Scheier-Dolberg on journeying in Shitao’s Returning Home, c. 1695.\n\nThis gemlike work demonstrates both Shitao’s mastery of the album format and his ability to innovate within it. Landscape scenes alternate with tightly cropped floral vignettes, taking the viewer on a rollercoaster ride with each turn of the page. Shitao’s calligraphy, too, changes with each leaf, seeming to mirror the shifts in content and style. The artist created this work after he had abandoned his dream of finding fame in Beijing and returned south to become a professional painter. The journey, which begins in the first leaf with a landscape scene, culminates in leaf five, with a man in a boat—almost certainly Shitao himself—passing through a desolate river landscape, before finding resolution in the final image of a single narcissus.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Kenneth Moore on gratitude in Goto Teijo’s Koto, c. 1440–1512.\n\nThis rare acquisition is a tour de force of Japanese decorative and musical arts that is currently unparalleled in this country. Although a strong tradition existed before then, the foundation for modern Japanese koto music were formed during the seventeenth century. This koto, with it copious inlay and remarkable metalwork by Teijo, ninth master and perhaps most skilled member of the famous Goto family of metalwork artists, documents this important musical development. It also reflects the status of its owner and the koto\u0027s role as a symbol of Japan. All but the instrument\u0027s playing areas are exceptionally decorated. Gold crane medallions set against a finely carved diaper pattern adorn the sides, which are framed in a virtuosic rendering of inlaid woods, horn, ivory, and wire that extends onto both the upper and lower surfaces. The ends, of tagayasan and shitan wood, are embellished with geometric inlay patterns and metalwork lions and flowers in ivory frames. The elaborate black lacquered outer case, dating from the early nineteenth century, is decorated with gold makai-e cranes (symbol of the Karasumaru family) and geese, and its interior is lined with gold foil patterned with flying geese. The cloth wrap is composed of two silk embroidered fabrics of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century origin.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

This example, carved from mottled brown marble about 1455–60, is particularly successful. The Virgin sits on an elaborate throne, with scrolled armrests projecting in high relief. Both she and the Christ Child in her arms seem strangely subdued, perhaps contemplating Christ\u0027s future suffering. The protective, caressing gesture of the Virgin\u0027s left hand is especially poignant.\n\nThe surface is richly contoured and decorated, and the concern for finish extends to the background, which is enlivened by the heads and feathery wings of seraphim. Typical of painters of the period is the sculptor\u0027s attention to ornamental detail: the fringe of the Virgin\u0027s mantle, the haloes, and the strands of hair of both Virgin and Child are delicately highlighted with touches of gilding.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

The Madonna points to Jesus as the way to salvation; dressed like an ancient philosopher, he holds a scroll. One scholar has noted: \"Berlinghiero’s work operates with nuances . . .

Christ\u0027s encounter with two disciples on the road from Jerusalem to Emmaus is depicted at the top. According to the Gospel of Luke, the disciples, \"their faces full of gloom,\" lamented Christ\u0027s crucifixion to a stranger they met on the road. Knowing that he was not recognized, Christ explained that it was preordained that the Messiah must suffer in order to redeem humankind (Luke 24:13-27). The figures are not placed in an illusionistic setting but are portrayed against a neutral background. The travelers are equipped with appropriate traveling gear—staff, water gourd, and purse—and their spirited discussion is emphasized by their lively stride.\n\nIn the lower register, Christ appears to Mary Magdalene, who, according to the Gospel of John, stood weeping outside Jesus\u0027 empty tomb. Seeing Christ and thinking he was the gardener, she said, \"If it you, sir, who removed him, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\" Jesus said, \"Mary!\" She turned to him and said, \"Rabbuni!\" (Hebrew for \"My Master\"). Jesus said, \"Noli me tangere [Do not touch me] for I have not as yet ascended to the Father\" (John 20:11-17). The drama of both these narratives is effectively conveyed through the vigorous, elongated bodies, gesturing heads, and large hands. The swirling drapery with pearled borders similarly emphasizes the action.

It was viewed by his heirs as his artistic testament and was retained by them for more than a century. To our eyes, the altarpiece’s unfinished—or \"non finito\"—style seems a crucial step towards modernism, to be compared with, for example, Goya\u0027s \"black paintings.\" Bassano explores an expressive intensity—dark in mood as in the palette—that is a direct and deeply personal response to Titian\u0027s late pictures. He interprets the baptism of Christ not as a sunny event in a pastoral landscape but as the tragic opening of Christ\u0027s Passion.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

The compression of these events into one scene with its complex interweaving of figural masses creates a powerful sculptural statement. \n\nIn the medieval church the choir screen separated the nave and the choir area. By the thirteenth century these barriers often were decorated with extensive narrative themes, especially the Passion, the dramatic final events in the earthly life of Jesus. Because they hindered participation in church rituals by the laity, most European churches eventually eliminated them. The choir screen at the cathedral in Amiens was destroyed in 1755. This relief is one of the largest and best preserved narrative sculptures to survive.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Together with a second, very similar female figure (now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo) this statue flanked the group of twenty two models of gardens, workshops, boats, and a funeral procession that were crammed into the chamber\u0027s narrow space. Striding forward with her left leg, the woman carries on her head a basket filled with cuts of meat. In her right hand she holds a live duck by its wings. The figure\u0027s iconography is well known from reliefs of the Old Kingdom in which rows of offering bearers were depicted. Place names were often written beside these figures identifying them as personifications of estates that would provide sustenance for the spirit of the tomb owner in perpetuity. The woman is richly adorned with jewelry and wears a dress decorated with a pattern of feathers, the kind of garment often associated with goddesses. Thus, this figure and its companion in Cairo may also be associated with the funerary goddesses Isis and Nephthys who are often depicted at the foot and head of coffins, protecting the deceased. \n\nAll the accessible rooms in the tomb of Meketre had been plundered in ancient times, but, early in 1920, the Museum\u0027s excavator, Herbert Winlock had his workmen clean out the accumulated debris in order to obtain an accurate floor plan of the tomb. It was during this cleaning operation that the small hidden chamber was discovered, filled with its almost perfectly preserved models and the two statues. In the division of finds between the Egyptian Government and the Metropolitan Museum, half of the contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and half came to New York.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Other iconographic details, such as the royal beard, the large and detailed broad collar, the scepter of merged \"was\" and \"djed\" signs, and a platform representing the hieroglyph for universal order, as well as the brilliant blue stone, communicate four important epithets: Lord of Lower Egypt, Master Craftsman, Lord of Truth, and Lord of the Sky.\n\nThe superior carving of the god\u0027s face, scepter, and jewelry is astonishing for a piece of such diminutive size and hard stone. Its style and quality suggests the sculpture was made in a royal workshop and most likely intended for use as a votive piece in Ptah\u0027s large temple at Memphis or in a small shrine dedicated to the god elsewhere in Egypt.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Bieri reliquary figures, such as this 19th century example, embody the qualities that the Fang admire most in people—namely, tranquility, vitality, and the ability to hold opposites in balance. Such wooden figures and heads are placed on top of bark containers that hold the precious relics of important clan ancestors. The carved head or figure mounted on top of the reliquary box guards the sacred contents against the forbidden gaze of women and uninitiated boys. Before being removed from Africa, such works were invariably separated from the relic containers that they originally enhanced. \n\nThis formidable female figure personifies controlled exuberance. Despite her contemplative expression, her being exudes vitality and boundless physical dynamism. The eyes are defined as deeply incised pupils within expansive recesses. These concave passages are echoed in the round at the summit of the forehead by the bold globular projections of the coiffure elements. This regal and original arrangement of hair is highly detailed. Several contiguous crests extend across the crown of the head and are gathered in a single vertical tress at the nape of the neck. \n\nThe Fang sculptor, who lucidly articulated this figure as a series of discrete component elements, integrated them masterfully into a seamless form to stunning effect. The pronounced ovoid volume of the head is abruptly juxtaposed with the broad columnar neck. At the outer corner of each eye a deep arc extends to the bridge of the nose. The nostrils are slightly flared, and the open mouth is cast as a broad oval. Especially alluring is the effect of the shimmering highlights that glance off the luminous midnight black wood, which is thoroughly saturated with oil. Another arresting visual accent is provided by the pendent oval breasts. These do not appear as sensuous elements but rather as overt attributes of power. Their formal definition complements the muscular curves of the physiognomy, so that they are echoed in the successively larger cylindrical units of the shoulders, upper arms, and forearms. The arms are bent at the elbows, hands held in front of the body in a pose suggesting arrested animation. \n\nPositioned as freestanding with slightly flexed knees, the figure appears to shift her weight slightly to the proper right side. The fact that she was originally conceived as seated is apparent from the extreme abbreviation of the powerful thighs, when seen frontally, in contrast to the full forms of the elongated calves. On the reverse side the vertical channel of the spine extends the length of the back and intersects with the horizontal passage of the buttocks. The original patrons sought to repair a break to the proper left shoulderaffixing horizontal metal bands with five nails to the front and reverse side. Two brass rings appear around the neck as well as one around the proper left wrist and each ankle. \n\nThis work was owned successively by two members of the Western avant-garde, André Derain and Jacob Epstein. \n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Little, designed and built between 1912 and 1914 in Wayzata, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The room epitomizes Wright\u0027s concept of \"organic architecture,\" in which the building, setting, interior, and furnishings are inextricably related. The house is composed of a group of low pavilions interspersed with gardens and terraces, which, in plan, radiate from a central symbolic hearth. The Frank Lloyd Wright Room also exemplifies one of Wright\u0027s most important contributions to modern architecture: the idea of spatial continuity. Low overhanging roofs and geometric window \"grilles\" with stylized plant motifs once linked the interior visually and spatially to the wooded site overlooking Lake Minnetonka. The living room itself is not merely a single, enclosed volume but a series of horizontal levels surrounded by glass, which allows the interplay of natural light and the rich, earthy tones that Wright employed throughout the room.\n\nThis room achieves tonal harmony through the combination of ocher plaster walls, natural oak trim and flooring, the use of the exterior reddish brown bricks for the fireplace, and leaded windows with an electroplated copper finish. The bold forms of the oak furniture were likewise conceived as an integral part of the composition. The center of the room is empty and furniture groupings enliven the peripheral space.

The use of Japanese prints and natural flower arrangements are characteristic Wright touches.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

The intriguing group has been variously interpreted as a family comprising a grandfather, a father, and a son, or as one man at three different stages of life. The latter is most unlikely as the multiple representations of a single individual in one statue are not shown interacting as they do here. In fact careful examination of the faces and figures points to the fact that the statue is a kind of domestic icon. The figure at left is a high-status individual and likely the oldest; he is probably a revered relative or the respected overlord of the man and boy who stand closely entwined with one another. The statuette would probably have received veneration in the household of its owner while he was a student in Rome.\n\nAre you an educator? Here\u0027s a related lesson plan.

The plump young lady sits in a relaxed pose, accompanied by a playful lapdog next to her slipper. Bright, clear-toned glazes—a recent innovation in ceramic technology—enhance the beauty of her clothes with striking colors, amber yellow for her jacket and bright green for her sash and skirts. The hourglass-shaped stool, originally made of rattan, points to the trade and exchange with South Asia during this prosperous and cosmopolitan age. This classic example of Tang sculpture illustrates the artistic sophistication of figural representation in the eighth century, when Chinese artists first mastered the skills to represent the human form in the round and with naturalistic details, which they adopted from the West through Buddhist art. At the same time, they maintained a certain degree of the Chinese linear tradition, as shown in the rhythmic drapery folds.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

A plaster copy has been set on the monument itself. The sphinx, a mythological creature with a lion\u0027s body and a human head, was known in various forms throughout the eastern Mediterranean region from the Bronze Age onward. The Greeks represented it as a winged female and often placed its image on grave monuments as guardian of the dead. This sphinx, which retains abundant traces of red, black, and blue pigment, was carved separately from the capital on which it stands. Its plinth was let into a socket at the top of the capital and secured by a metal dowel and a bed of molten lead. The capital is in the form of two double volutes (spiral scrolls) designed like a lyre. The front face of the capital also had a painted design of palmettes and volutes.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

In a style referred to by Flemish weavers at the time as \"English fashion,\" it was intended to hang between the cornice and the dado of a wood-paneled room. The tapestry is attributed on stylistic, iconographic and technical grounds to Flemish immigrant weavers who sought refuge from the religious tumult of the era by relocating to England, probably London. In excellent condition, it is a particularly engaging example of the output of this fascinating and only recently studied diaspora of weavers from Flanders. The tapestry is notable for its weavers\u0027 remarkable use of color in the construction of forms and effects of light and cast shadow. The idyllic landscape contrasts vistas of pastoral relaxation with a hunting scene, flanking a central moated building. \n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

By the turn of the century, amateurs everywhere were filling album pages with the fruits of their own labors. Mass-media imagery suited the album format just as well. Sparked by advancements in photomechanical reproduction, a profusion of new illustrated magazines began to appear just after the turn of the century. This, in tandem with a burgeoning film industry—well off the ground by 1910—wrought dramatic changes in public perceptions of fame, sophistication, and ideal beauty.\n\nGirls I Have Known, compiled by Daniel Rochford when he was sixteen, stands at the crossroads of these various cultural and technological currents. This eccentric scrapbook-filled with handwritten commentary, folded notes passed in school, and snapshot portraits—documents the \"girls\" the author has liked (and disliked), from his first kindergarten \"crushes\" to later, unrequited high-school romances. More than an example of oddball juvenilia, Girls I Have Known is a testament to photography\u0027s signal importance in the structuring of mass desire at the dawn of the media age.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"dedicated-myself","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe4f41e1f","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/m9lzVBf1Piq13oDXWgno65yIQNNSJLIHcn9ZHpSgbeDD4W_xrd70t_TRDZZK9hZl62TD1Itrp32y0fyHILLFzSwF","lastModified":1548921535897,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22472,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691446,"title":"Groom and Rider","description":"Met curator Sheila Canby on the economy of line in Groom and Rider from Tabriz, Iran, 1540–50.\n\nThe subject of horseman and groom is common in Safavid art.

It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sithathoryunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: \"The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].\"\n\nThis cloisonné pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning \"encircled,\" thus declaring the solar deity\u0027s supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khakheperre. Flanking the king\u0027s name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning \"life\") suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons\u0027 heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing \"millions of years.\" Thus the king\u0027s life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.\n\nJewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was not simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.\n\nSince the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Graff on life force in Two Panels with striding lions from Babylon, c. 604–562 B.C.E.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire fell before the combined onslaughts of Babylonians and Medes in 614 and 612 B.C. In the empire\u0027s final days, Nabopolassar (r. 625–605 B.C.), who had been in Assyrian service, established a new dynasty with its capital in Babylon. During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar\u0027s ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for the control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem. During this period Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building and Babylon became a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city\u0027s gates and buildings. \n\nThe most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or \"House of the New Year\u0027s Festival.\" The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of the weather god Adad and of Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.  \n\nAre you an educator?

Upon her death in 1727, Menshikov\u0027s opponents instigated a political rebellion. Menshikov, who had been knighted in 1703 and received the rank of prince in 1705, was stripped of his possessions and title and exiled to northern Siberia, where he died in poverty.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Whatever the age of the owner at her death, she was given a youthful countenance for the eternal afterlife. The shape of the face, with its long slender nose, sloe eyes, and sensuous mouth, identifies it as a product of the latter half of the Amarna period. The jar and lid were altered in antiquity, making it extremely difficult to identify the original owner.\n\nThe striking face carved on the jar lid represents one of the royal women of Amarna. Her hairstyle of overlapping curls, known as the Nubian wig, was worn only by adults and was popular among the female members of Akhenaten\u0027s family. The hole at the center of the forehead once secured the separately carved upper body of a rearing cobra whose tail is visible across the top of the wig. This royal protector was exclusively worn by kings and queens. Since its discovery in 1907, the face has been variously identified as that of Queen Tiye, Akhenaten\u0027s mother; Queen Nefertiti, his principal wife; Queen Kiya, his beloved secondary wife; and Princess Merytaten, his eldest daughter. For a time, it was even identified as Akhenaten himself. This confusion is understandable, since the inscription identifying the owner was almost completely erased. Faint traces of hieroglyphs indicate that the jar was originally inscribed for Kiya, and the Nubian wig is most frequently associated with this queen. In some respects, however, the face more closely resembles later representations of Tiye, and it is possible that the lid originally belonged to her burial equipment and was later placed on Kiya\u0027s canopic jar.\n\nThe tomb in which the jar was found, KV 55 in the Valley of the Kings, is probably the most controversial of all Egyptian tombs. It contained burial equipment inscribed for Queen Tiye and magical bricks with the name of Akhenaten. There were also four canopic jars (including this one) and an inlaid wooden coffin almost certainly made for Kiya. It appears that, for safekeeping, Tutankhamun had this material transferred to Thebes from Akhenaten\u0027s tomb at Amarna, which seems to have been plundered soon after Akhenaten\u0027s death. The jars and coffin of Kiya may have been reused at that time for the burial of another member of the royal family.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Back in New York, following his service in the army (ca. 1950–51), Johns became acquainted with artist Robert Rauschenberg, composer John Cage, and dancer Merce Cunningham. By the mid- to late 1950s Johns had already achieved fame with his paintings of targets, numerals, and American flags, and his work was exhibited in prominent museums and galleries in New York. \"White Flag\" of 1955, recently acquired by the Metropolitan from the artist\u0027s own collection, exemplifies Johns\u0027s early style, which engendered a wide range of subsequent art movements, among them Pop Art, Minimal Art, and Conceptual Art. During the 1950s and 1960s Johns frequently appropriated well-known images (such as targets, flags, and beer cans), elevating them to cultural icons. Throughout his oeuvre — which includes painting, prints, drawings, and sculpture — images are constantly recycled and combined in extensive series. In his later compositions of the 1970s, Johns filled the surface of his pictures with colorful cross-hatchings (suggested by the passing cars on an expressway); and since the 1980s he has incorporated images that have more autobiographical significance.\n\n\"White Flag\" is the largest of his flag paintings and the first in which the flag is presented in monochrome. By draining most of the color from the flag but leaving subtle gradations in tone, the artist shifts our attention from the familiarity of the image to the way in which it is made. \"White Flag\" is painted on three separate panels: the stars, the seven upper stripes to the right of the stars, and the longer stripes below. Johns worked on each panel separately. After applying a ground of unbleached beeswax, he built up the stars, the negative areas around them, and the stripes with applications of collage—cut or torn pieces of newsprint, other papers, and bits of fabric. He dipped these into molten beeswax and adhered them to the surface. He then joined the three panels and overpainted them with more beeswax mixed with pigments, adding touches of white oil.\n\nThe fast-setting medium of encaustic enabled Johns to make each brushstroke distinct, while the forty-eight-star flag design—contiguous with the perimeters of the canvas— provided a structure for the richly varied surface, which ranges from translucent to opaque.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"below-the-surface","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x876db2db","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/jsDARZEP0Ax137Qp-WeMX2w_e3IkHbu_jh6vyA07HScrRPp77wU_trgSXFZZPgCvc9coJi2UbGIJOhSxVlcTqV24","lastModified":1548921542334,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22520,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691010,"title":"Topic A: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 4th Grade, Module 6 Topic A","entryId":"4th-m6-ta-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/4th-grade-foundations-engageny/4th-m6-engage-ny-foundations#4th-m6-ta-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921616441,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22910,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691397,"title":"Helmschmid, Portions of a costume armor","description":"Met curator Pierre Terjanian on illusion in Kolman Helmschmid’s Portions of a costume armor, c. 1525.\n\nThis armor reproduces in steel the extravagant puffed and slashed costume of the German Landsknechte (mercenary infantry troops).

The rim of the roundel, consisting of eighteen thumbnail-shaped cells for turquoise inlay in the manner of some Sarmatian roundels, frames the openwork figure of an eagle in high relief. Grasping a small, crouching animal in its talons, the bird perches in three-quarter view, facing right, with its chest extended and the rest of its body receding into the background. Its wings are outspread, the one on the left seen emerging from behind the swelling of the chest and the one on the right receding into the back plane. The body and legs carry ridges and linear patterning to suggest the texture of feathers. The bird\u0027s head is in profile, with a cell for the prominent ear, a protrusion at the eye area, a curved beak, and a downcurved line for the mouth. The entire figure is worked in the round, although the back is distorted and not as carefully finished as the front. The eagle\u0027s prey has been variously identified as an antelope, a goat, and a hare. Turquoise is inlaid in its large ear and in several places on its body. The tabs on either side of the roundel have cells for inlays at the corners in the form of debased acanthus leaves.\n\nThis piece is one of a pair; its mate, in the British Museum, London, depicts an eagle facing the opposite way. It was thought by Ernst Herzfeld to be part of a treasure found in 1910–11 in a chamber tomb near Nihavend in Iran. Herzfeld speculated that this trove had belonged to an aristocratic Parthian family and had originally included a group of Roman gold coins of the first to second century C.E. that surfaced independently in modern times. Another related piece of jewelry, found in excavations at Dalverzin Tepe in Iran, can be dated archaeologically to the first century C.E.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.  \n\nAre you an educator?

In Peru, nose ornaments became less fashionable in the second half of the first millennium A.D. and were seldom used after about 600. This elegant, very delicate crescent nose ring from northern Peru is evidence of the high level of craftsmanship that existed among metalworkers at this time. Depicted are four spiders sitting in their web. The openwork, lacelike quality of the object was achieved by fusing the many minute parts together to create a symmetrical composition. The stylized spiders, their tiny eyes and fangs showing, are held, each in its own open space, by paired, spindly legs echoing the round bodies and joined to the web. Spider imagery occurs in Peruvian art from the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. onward, suggesting that spiders played a role in early Andean mythology.

He began his design career in the 1930s. It peaked between the late 1940s and mid- 1950s, when his scarce and highly original gowns were sought after by society\u0027s most prominent women. Personally draping and constructing the garments that bear his label, he is considered to be the only American to work in the true couture tradition. James saw himself as an artist and sculptor of dress rather than a dressmaker. He manipulated fabrics into dramatic shapes using complex seaming and sometimes complicated understructures to create his singular vision of timeless elegance. A master of the relationship between form, color and texture, he often heightened the drama of his evening wear by combining several like fabrics of different colors, or different fabrics in like colors but with different light reflective qualities. Also a perfectionist, he worked for years on refining certain seam lines, shapes and constructs that particularly expressed his vision of artistry through rigorous engineering. Many of his pieces are conceived asymmetrically and possess a sense of movement and vitality that is a signature characteristic of his work. Many historical references in shapes and construction, especially the drapery forms of the 1870s and early teens, are also prevalent throughout his work.\n\nThe construction of this dress reconfigures the body by having the harder draped fabric brought forward and soft fabric at the back, the opposite from the norm, giving the appearance of front and back being reversed. The startling color contrast and different reflective qualities of satin, wool-backed crepe and faille in the skirt reinforce this deception. The form of the hips bears witness to James\u0027 claims of being a sculptor of fabric.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"hipster","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xdf4d4d05","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/D3D47UkrtP2kyRdK2xTim8nMCLH1ZbKuBltWL5DGhYppW1fwSxOS9zDHdJ9qOSXaiNPp1fe6RxRA4Xrx8IMbP6A","lastModified":1548921547645,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22549,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691370,"title":"Documenting Conflict","description":"By its very nature, art is a kind of documentation—it reflects the society in which it was made, and the intention of the artist who created it.

In this interview from her New York studio, she talks about what her life was like at the centre of French modernism, and how she learned from her peers yet forged her own style even among the superstars of an art movement.

Because they can bear witness to and capture life very nearly as we see it, photography has a unique relationship to reality among the arts. This can be seen in the evolution of photography from pure reportage to more creative forms of documentation. While the photographs in this exhibition serve to document and give proof to instances of conflict, very rarely do they show it explicitly: in some photos there isn’t a single weapon, just the faces of those who served as witnesses to a trauma. By showing what no longer is there, they document and immortalize the effects of violence on the landscape, human body, and psyche, from shell-shocked soldiers in Vietnam to empty fields in Flanders.\n\nPhotographs have the power to document, to capture images and the lingering effects of events on places and people.
