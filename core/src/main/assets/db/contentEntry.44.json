As you already know, this course looks at history at a larger scale than any other history course we’ve seen, and studying time and space over 13.8 billion years poses an interesting challenge. One way of dealing with this challenge is by using different scales so that each topic can be studied from the appropriate perspective. In this lesson, you’ll watch a video on scale, and then take part in an activity that will get you out of your chair. By the time you’ve seen the video and finished the activity, you’ll have a good sense of how scale can affect the way we view things.","entryId":"scale","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/what-is-big-history#scale","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921466535,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22033,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691884,"title":"Powers of Ten™ (1977)","description":"Powers of Ten takes us on an adventure in magnitude.","entryId":"powers-of-ten","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x06877d70","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/w3yIlo0caNOPc29nFjVwHi_3MIv-u1wCiyqW7HvS3du2NIfVvNTdc2Nop-ccH-nurdiFe-C-yD_wi1xkaGQ2KfoQ","lastModified":1548921466929,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22036,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691882,"title":"Making mother-of-pearl lacquerware","description":"Artist Kwangwoo Bae demonstrates the process of making Korean mother-of-pearl lacquerware.

The world, in effect, was divided into four unconnected regions, none of which was really interested in the others. With the improved transportation and communication technologies developed 500 years ago, humans acquired the means for connecting these formerly independent zones. After 1492, for example, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were put in regular contact, and the Columbian Exchange saw the transfer of people, ideas, animals, plants, and diseases between these two once separate world zones. Exchanges like these fueled social, political, economic, and intellectual innovation. Within a few hundred years, this more fully connected world saw dramatic acceleration in innovation and population growth, which ushered in the Modern Revolution.

Whether you look at temperature, types of vegetation, soils, or sea level, the basic characteristics of the biosphere have remained about the same, having shown only moderate variation at any point within most of that time frame. That type of consistency is what prompted geologists to label the last 10,000 years of geological history as the Holocene Epoch; an epoch that was ushered in at the end of the last ice age. But there are now a number of scientists who view the data from the last 250 years and conclude that the biosphere is showing fundamentally different characteristics from the previous 10,000 years. The rise of carbon dioxide levels, glacial melting, and the shrinking of tropical rainforests are just some of the factors that they cite as evidence that the biosphere has entered a new epoch. Because so much of the change they have identified seems to derive from human activity, these scientists propose that this new epoch be called the Anthropocene to reflect the tremendous impact that humans now exert in the biosphere.

No one discipline can know all there is to know about absolutely everything. It would be impossible to think of all the questions to ask, let alone have all the answers. Usually, if we look at any single object or event from the points of view of multiple areas of expertise, we can put together a rich understanding that goes far beyond a one-discipline approach.","entryId":"what-are-disciplines","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/what-is-big-history#what-are-disciplines","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921472679,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22072,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691847,"title":"Gallery: The Modern World","description":"","entryId":"gallery-the-modern-world","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xe1797dd3","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921472679,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22072,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691846,"title":"Ancient Rome","description":"The Roman empire was so large that five departments of the British Museum hold art and artefacts from it.

This world is very different from the world of 500 or 1,000 years ago, let alone 10,000 or 100,000 years ago. The connection of the four world zones allowed for the creation of a global network of exchange. Though this network was not built overnight, it emerged fairly quickly, and it increased the potential connections and diversity of connections for many members of the network. The result was an acceleration of both collective learning and innovation. Commerce was an important driver of change in this global network. Because commerce began to take on greater significance for many societies, a number of important thinkers began to ask questions about the nature of the exchange of goods, the nature of productivity and efficiency, and the interests of the individual and the state in business. All of this new inquiry gave birth to the discipline of economics. These economic thinkers, like the thinkers in any discipline, shared a set of concerns and questions but often came up with very different answers to those questions. The articulation of the ideas of capitalism and communism were the most influential economic ideas generated in the course of the Modern Revolution.

The relic would have been held in a cavity at the back of the reliquary but it is no longer contained inside. There is no record of relics being contained inside the reliquary beyond 1871.\n\nSt Baudime’s reliquary has a turbulent history – the gemstones which were once studded all over his vestments were likely removed during the French Revolution in the 1790s. The reliquary was also stolen at the beginning of the 20th century by a notorious art thief. It was found soon after by police, apparently languishing in a wine cellar.\n\nWe might normally expect this type of reliquary (known as a ‘speaking reliquary’) to contain a skull – as the form of the reliquary would literally speak its contents. However, there is no record of this container ever having held a skull relic, which further adds to the object’s mystery. © Trustees of the British Museum\n","entryId":"st-baudime","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x6da80171","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/_sojRknqP2QoVq4YMgLgacjhKJKvs-sQIsw15t9JgBakV7qiUwxt4g4heV9Ws-Encol9cElBlDQswKw5j3If5XY","lastModified":1548921479252,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22115,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691804,"title":"Video Transcripts","description":"","entryId":"video-transcripts-9","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x9e7ee2df","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921479510,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22116,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691803,"title":"Web Links","description":"","entryId":"web-links-1","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x3e2e7b02","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921479565,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22117,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691802,"title":"Resources","description":"Download the teacher resources from the Big History Project classroom version of this course.

It would be impossible for any history course to cover everything related to its subject matter, and this challenge is particularly great in Big History because of the scales of time and size involved. Big History deals with this challenge by focusing on the eight turning points, or thresholds, over the course of the 13.8 billion-year story. At each of these thresholds, the Universe became more complex, and things appeared with significant new emergent properties. In this lesson, you’ll review what you’ve learned about this story, which will put you in the perfect position to think about the future of Big History in subsequent lessons in this unit.

The biosphere changes as a result of astronomical, geological, and biological influences. The dinosaurs, for example, became extinct as a result of an astronomical event—the effects of an asteroid impact on Earth. Every species impacts the biosphere, though the extent of that impact can vary dramatically. The impact of humans has changed over time. The impact of foragers was not dramatic, but these early humans did have the ability to destroy flora and fauna and cause fires in different parts of the Earth. Agriculture, and later the modern revolution, significantly increased the impact of humans on the biosphere. The acceleration of the last 100 years has seen an acceleration of these human impacts on the biosphere. What are the most significant of these impacts and what should humans be doing about them?

Why did it happen? What lessons can be drawn from these events? Studying the past is possible because there is lots of interesting evidence left behind for scholars of many disciplines—not just historians—to look at. Physicists, for example, can look at the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Universe today and draw conclusions about the early history of the Universe. Geologists can look at the distribution of plants and animals and rock formations on the Earth today and draw conclusions about the how the configuration of the Earth’s continents has changed over time. Each discipline has its own questions and evidence and is interested in investigating change over time. Historians don’t typically predict the future, but given the number of trends you’ve studied in this course, it seems appropriate to give some thought to what the future might be like.","entryId":"looking-forward","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/big-history-project/future#looking-forward","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921489954,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22170,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691749,"title":"Ancient glass at the Getty","description":"","entryId":"ancient-glass-at-the-getty","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x83277959","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921490044,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22171,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691748,"title":"Powell on the Second Gulf War","description":"Post 9/11 diplomacy and how the United States came to the conclusion to take military action in Iraq.

Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God\u0027s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent\u0027s wiles.\n\nIn 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.\n\nThe exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project.

Made in the early 1490s for the tomb of Doge Andrea Vendramin, it is the only signed sculpture from that monumental complex. The serene, idealized figure, inspired by ancient sculpture, is deceptively complex. Carefully manipulating composition and finish, Tullio created God\u0027s perfect human being, but also the anxious victim of the serpent\u0027s wiles.\n\nIn 2002, Adam was gravely damaged in an accident. Committed to returning it to public view, the Museum undertook a conservation treatment that has restored the sculpture to its original appearance to the fullest extent possible.\n\nThe exhibition allows Adam to be viewed in the round and explains this unprecedented twelve-year research and conservation project. It also inaugurates a new permanent gallery for Venetian and northern Italian sculpture. The installation of this gallery was made possible by Assunta Sommella Peluso, Ignazio Peluso, Ada Peluso, and Romano I.

This example is the oldest of the three extant pianos by Cristofori. About 1700 he began to work on an instrument on which the player could achieve changes in loudness solely by changing the force with which the keys were struck. By 1700 he had made at least one successful instrument, which he called \"gravicembalo col piano e forte\" (harpsichord with soft and loud). His instrument still generally resembles a harpsichord, though its case is thicker and the quill mechanism has been replaced by a hammer mechanism. Cristofori\u0027s hammer mechanism is so well designed and made that no other of comparable sensitivity and reliability was devised for another seventy-five years. In fact, the highly complex action of the modern piano may be traced directly to his original conception.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"phenomenon","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x4832d4b2","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZZV3N2xhr8oR8AEMd3uYvobBPSCqQ1oaSBiZjD5l_gTNvC4GwdMDwGrWB92k_reEbfsBr9bwMO-HCY90AHr0iLU","lastModified":1548921516980,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22345,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691570,"title":"Shitao, Returning Home","description":"Met curator Joseph Scheier-Dolberg on journeying in Shitao’s Returning Home, c. 1695.\n\nThis gemlike work demonstrates both Shitao’s mastery of the album format and his ability to innovate within it. Landscape scenes alternate with tightly cropped floral vignettes, taking the viewer on a rollercoaster ride with each turn of the page. Shitao’s calligraphy, too, changes with each leaf, seeming to mirror the shifts in content and style. The artist created this work after he had abandoned his dream of finding fame in Beijing and returned south to become a professional painter. The journey, which begins in the first leaf with a landscape scene, culminates in leaf five, with a man in a boat—almost certainly Shitao himself—passing through a desolate river landscape, before finding resolution in the final image of a single narcissus.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Kenneth Moore on gratitude in Goto Teijo’s Koto, c. 1440–1512.\n\nThis rare acquisition is a tour de force of Japanese decorative and musical arts that is currently unparalleled in this country. Although a strong tradition existed before then, the foundation for modern Japanese koto music were formed during the seventeenth century. This koto, with it copious inlay and remarkable metalwork by Teijo, ninth master and perhaps most skilled member of the famous Goto family of metalwork artists, documents this important musical development. It also reflects the status of its owner and the koto\u0027s role as a symbol of Japan. All but the instrument\u0027s playing areas are exceptionally decorated. Gold crane medallions set against a finely carved diaper pattern adorn the sides, which are framed in a virtuosic rendering of inlaid woods, horn, ivory, and wire that extends onto both the upper and lower surfaces. The ends, of tagayasan and shitan wood, are embellished with geometric inlay patterns and metalwork lions and flowers in ivory frames. The elaborate black lacquered outer case, dating from the early nineteenth century, is decorated with gold makai-e cranes (symbol of the Karasumaru family) and geese, and its interior is lined with gold foil patterned with flying geese. The cloth wrap is composed of two silk embroidered fabrics of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century origin.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

This example, carved from mottled brown marble about 1455–60, is particularly successful. The Virgin sits on an elaborate throne, with scrolled armrests projecting in high relief. Both she and the Christ Child in her arms seem strangely subdued, perhaps contemplating Christ\u0027s future suffering. The protective, caressing gesture of the Virgin\u0027s left hand is especially poignant.\n\nThe surface is richly contoured and decorated, and the concern for finish extends to the background, which is enlivened by the heads and feathery wings of seraphim. Typical of painters of the period is the sculptor\u0027s attention to ornamental detail: the fringe of the Virgin\u0027s mantle, the haloes, and the strands of hair of both Virgin and Child are delicately highlighted with touches of gilding.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

It follows the Byzantine type known as the Hodegetria (\"She who shows the way\"), familiar from icons that arrived in Italy following the fall of Constantinople in 1204. The Madonna points to Jesus as the way to salvation; dressed like an ancient philosopher, he holds a scroll. One scholar has noted: \"Berlinghiero’s work operates with nuances . . .

Christ\u0027s encounter with two disciples on the road from Jerusalem to Emmaus is depicted at the top. According to the Gospel of Luke, the disciples, \"their faces full of gloom,\" lamented Christ\u0027s crucifixion to a stranger they met on the road. Knowing that he was not recognized, Christ explained that it was preordained that the Messiah must suffer in order to redeem humankind (Luke 24:13-27). The figures are not placed in an illusionistic setting but are portrayed against a neutral background. The travelers are equipped with appropriate traveling gear—staff, water gourd, and purse—and their spirited discussion is emphasized by their lively stride.\n\nIn the lower register, Christ appears to Mary Magdalene, who, according to the Gospel of John, stood weeping outside Jesus\u0027 empty tomb. Seeing Christ and thinking he was the gardener, she said, \"If it you, sir, who removed him, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\" Jesus said, \"Mary!\" She turned to him and said, \"Rabbuni!\" (Hebrew for \"My Master\"). Jesus said, \"Noli me tangere [Do not touch me] for I have not as yet ascended to the Father\" (John 20:11-17). The drama of both these narratives is effectively conveyed through the vigorous, elongated bodies, gesturing heads, and large hands. The swirling drapery with pearled borders similarly emphasizes the action.

It was viewed by his heirs as his artistic testament and was retained by them for more than a century. To our eyes, the altarpiece’s unfinished—or \"non finito\"—style seems a crucial step towards modernism, to be compared with, for example, Goya\u0027s \"black paintings.\" Bassano explores an expressive intensity—dark in mood as in the palette—that is a direct and deeply personal response to Titian\u0027s late pictures. He interprets the baptism of Christ not as a sunny event in a pastoral landscape but as the tragic opening of Christ\u0027s Passion.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

The compression of these events into one scene with its complex interweaving of figural masses creates a powerful sculptural statement. \n\nIn the medieval church the choir screen separated the nave and the choir area. By the thirteenth century these barriers often were decorated with extensive narrative themes, especially the Passion, the dramatic final events in the earthly life of Jesus. Because they hindered participation in church rituals by the laity, most European churches eventually eliminated them. The choir screen at the cathedral in Amiens was destroyed in 1755. This relief is one of the largest and best preserved narrative sculptures to survive.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Together with a second, very similar female figure (now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo) this statue flanked the group of twenty two models of gardens, workshops, boats, and a funeral procession that were crammed into the chamber\u0027s narrow space. Striding forward with her left leg, the woman carries on her head a basket filled with cuts of meat. In her right hand she holds a live duck by its wings. The figure\u0027s iconography is well known from reliefs of the Old Kingdom in which rows of offering bearers were depicted. Place names were often written beside these figures identifying them as personifications of estates that would provide sustenance for the spirit of the tomb owner in perpetuity. The woman is richly adorned with jewelry and wears a dress decorated with a pattern of feathers, the kind of garment often associated with goddesses. Thus, this figure and its companion in Cairo may also be associated with the funerary goddesses Isis and Nephthys who are often depicted at the foot and head of coffins, protecting the deceased. \n\nAll the accessible rooms in the tomb of Meketre had been plundered in ancient times, but, early in 1920, the Museum\u0027s excavator, Herbert Winlock had his workmen clean out the accumulated debris in order to obtain an accurate floor plan of the tomb. It was during this cleaning operation that the small hidden chamber was discovered, filled with its almost perfectly preserved models and the two statues. In the division of finds between the Egyptian Government and the Metropolitan Museum, half of the contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and half came to New York.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Other iconographic details, such as the royal beard, the large and detailed broad collar, the scepter of merged \"was\" and \"djed\" signs, and a platform representing the hieroglyph for universal order, as well as the brilliant blue stone, communicate four important epithets: Lord of Lower Egypt, Master Craftsman, Lord of Truth, and Lord of the Sky.\n\nThe superior carving of the god\u0027s face, scepter, and jewelry is astonishing for a piece of such diminutive size and hard stone.

Bieri reliquary figures, such as this 19th century example, embody the qualities that the Fang admire most in people—namely, tranquility, vitality, and the ability to hold opposites in balance. Such wooden figures and heads are placed on top of bark containers that hold the precious relics of important clan ancestors. The carved head or figure mounted on top of the reliquary box guards the sacred contents against the forbidden gaze of women and uninitiated boys. Before being removed from Africa, such works were invariably separated from the relic containers that they originally enhanced. \n\nThis formidable female figure personifies controlled exuberance. Despite her contemplative expression, her being exudes vitality and boundless physical dynamism. The eyes are defined as deeply incised pupils within expansive recesses. These concave passages are echoed in the round at the summit of the forehead by the bold globular projections of the coiffure elements. This regal and original arrangement of hair is highly detailed. Several contiguous crests extend across the crown of the head and are gathered in a single vertical tress at the nape of the neck. \n\nThe Fang sculptor, who lucidly articulated this figure as a series of discrete component elements, integrated them masterfully into a seamless form to stunning effect. The pronounced ovoid volume of the head is abruptly juxtaposed with the broad columnar neck. At the outer corner of each eye a deep arc extends to the bridge of the nose. The nostrils are slightly flared, and the open mouth is cast as a broad oval. Especially alluring is the effect of the shimmering highlights that glance off the luminous midnight black wood, which is thoroughly saturated with oil. Another arresting visual accent is provided by the pendent oval breasts. These do not appear as sensuous elements but rather as overt attributes of power. Their formal definition complements the muscular curves of the physiognomy, so that they are echoed in the successively larger cylindrical units of the shoulders, upper arms, and forearms. The arms are bent at the elbows, hands held in front of the body in a pose suggesting arrested animation. \n\nPositioned as freestanding with slightly flexed knees, the figure appears to shift her weight slightly to the proper right side. The fact that she was originally conceived as seated is apparent from the extreme abbreviation of the powerful thighs, when seen frontally, in contrast to the full forms of the elongated calves. On the reverse side the vertical channel of the spine extends the length of the back and intersects with the horizontal passage of the buttocks. The original patrons sought to repair a break to the proper left shoulderaffixing horizontal metal bands with five nails to the front and reverse side. Two brass rings appear around the neck as well as one around the proper left wrist and each ankle. \n\nThis work was owned successively by two members of the Western avant-garde, André Derain and Jacob Epstein. \n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Little, designed and built between 1912 and 1914 in Wayzata, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The room epitomizes Wright\u0027s concept of \"organic architecture,\" in which the building, setting, interior, and furnishings are inextricably related. The house is composed of a group of low pavilions interspersed with gardens and terraces, which, in plan, radiate from a central symbolic hearth. The Frank Lloyd Wright Room also exemplifies one of Wright\u0027s most important contributions to modern architecture: the idea of spatial continuity. Low overhanging roofs and geometric window \"grilles\" with stylized plant motifs once linked the interior visually and spatially to the wooded site overlooking Lake Minnetonka. The living room itself is not merely a single, enclosed volume but a series of horizontal levels surrounded by glass, which allows the interplay of natural light and the rich, earthy tones that Wright employed throughout the room.\n\nThis room achieves tonal harmony through the combination of ocher plaster walls, natural oak trim and flooring, the use of the exterior reddish brown bricks for the fireplace, and leaded windows with an electroplated copper finish. The bold forms of the oak furniture were likewise conceived as an integral part of the composition. The center of the room is empty and furniture groupings enliven the peripheral space.

The intriguing group has been variously interpreted as a family comprising a grandfather, a father, and a son, or as one man at three different stages of life. The latter is most unlikely as the multiple representations of a single individual in one statue are not shown interacting as they do here. In fact careful examination of the faces and figures points to the fact that the statue is a kind of domestic icon. The figure at left is a high-status individual and likely the oldest; he is probably a revered relative or the respected overlord of the man and boy who stand closely entwined with one another. The statuette would probably have received veneration in the household of its owner while he was a student in Rome.\n\nAre you an educator? Here\u0027s a related lesson plan.

As it was very rare and considered a special treasure, the most accomplished English silversmiths were often commissioned to make mounts for it. Pieces such as these were regarded as suitable for royal gifts or for the furnishing of princely houses. The ewer shown here is one of a group of Chinese porcelains of the Wan Li period (1575–1619) with silver-gilt mounts made by an unidentified English silversmith about 1585.

The plump young lady sits in a relaxed pose, accompanied by a playful lapdog next to her slipper. Bright, clear-toned glazes—a recent innovation in ceramic technology—enhance the beauty of her clothes with striking colors, amber yellow for her jacket and bright green for her sash and skirts. The hourglass-shaped stool, originally made of rattan, points to the trade and exchange with South Asia during this prosperous and cosmopolitan age. This classic example of Tang sculpture illustrates the artistic sophistication of figural representation in the eighth century, when Chinese artists first mastered the skills to represent the human form in the round and with naturalistic details, which they adopted from the West through Buddhist art. At the same time, they maintained a certain degree of the Chinese linear tradition, as shown in the rhythmic drapery folds.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

A plaster copy has been set on the monument itself. The sphinx, a mythological creature with a lion\u0027s body and a human head, was known in various forms throughout the eastern Mediterranean region from the Bronze Age onward. The Greeks represented it as a winged female and often placed its image on grave monuments as guardian of the dead. This sphinx, which retains abundant traces of red, black, and blue pigment, was carved separately from the capital on which it stands. Its plinth was let into a socket at the top of the capital and secured by a metal dowel and a bed of molten lead. The capital is in the form of two double volutes (spiral scrolls) designed like a lyre. The front face of the capital also had a painted design of palmettes and volutes.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

In a style referred to by Flemish weavers at the time as \"English fashion,\" it was intended to hang between the cornice and the dado of a wood-paneled room. The tapestry is attributed on stylistic, iconographic and technical grounds to Flemish immigrant weavers who sought refuge from the religious tumult of the era by relocating to England, probably London. In excellent condition, it is a particularly engaging example of the output of this fascinating and only recently studied diaspora of weavers from Flanders. The tapestry is notable for its weavers\u0027 remarkable use of color in the construction of forms and effects of light and cast shadow. The idyllic landscape contrasts vistas of pastoral relaxation with a hunting scene, flanking a central moated building. \n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

By the turn of the century, amateurs everywhere were filling album pages with the fruits of their own labors. Mass-media imagery suited the album format just as well. Sparked by advancements in photomechanical reproduction, a profusion of new illustrated magazines began to appear just after the turn of the century. This, in tandem with a burgeoning film industry—well off the ground by 1910—wrought dramatic changes in public perceptions of fame, sophistication, and ideal beauty.\n\nGirls I Have Known, compiled by Daniel Rochford when he was sixteen, stands at the crossroads of these various cultural and technological currents. This eccentric scrapbook-filled with handwritten commentary, folded notes passed in school, and snapshot portraits—documents the \"girls\" the author has liked (and disliked), from his first kindergarten \"crushes\" to later, unrequited high-school romances.

The Crucifixion is presented as an eyewitness account set against a distant landscape, astonishing for its depth and subtlety of description. By contrast, the Last Judgment is organized hieratically in three tiers, with the scale of the figures manipulated to indicate their relative importance. The biblical texts on the original frames relate specifically to the scenes depicted, establishing a play between word and image that would have been admired by contemporaries.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n","entryId":"noise","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x01161150","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/7RM6IIvNZ8CrnuT4SNNvZ_nZfLhA7RVq048vEXXzKP_xm5VGomK0ex1WCIy0lZMVNapkTMuo_hjnWNbuC3EEnPY","lastModified":1548921536869,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22479,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691440,"title":"\"Girl Before a Mirror\" by Pablo Picasso, 1932 | MoMA Education","description":"A MoMA educator discusses how she teaches \"Girl Before a Mirror\" by Pablo Picasso, 1932. Visit MoMA Learning for more teaching and learning resources.","entryId":"teaching-picasso","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xd694a122","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/aIOv5k6Sbh51TUf4pGibfZdtM2i63SmVgHRmD5rn_dC-x27Qu6mw8l35BLye-6sW7lpS2q-nfud6LM1jAMg4TOBM","lastModified":1548921537189,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22480,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691439,"title":"Art and Identity | Modern Art \u0026 Ideas","description":"Explore how artists like Frida Kahlo, Glenn Ligon, and Andy Warhol investigate and express ideas about identity in their work.

It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sithathoryunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: \"The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].\"\n\nThis cloisonné pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning \"encircled,\" thus declaring the solar deity\u0027s supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khakheperre. Flanking the king\u0027s name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning \"life\") suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons\u0027 heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing \"millions of years.\" Thus the king\u0027s life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.\n\nJewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was not simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.\n\nSince the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Graff on life force in Two Panels with striding lions from Babylon, c. 604–562 B.C.E.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire fell before the combined onslaughts of Babylonians and Medes in 614 and 612 B.C. In the empire\u0027s final days, Nabopolassar (r. 625–605 B.C.), who had been in Assyrian service, established a new dynasty with its capital in Babylon. During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar\u0027s ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for the control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem. During this period Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building and Babylon became a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city\u0027s gates and buildings. \n\nThe most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or \"House of the New Year\u0027s Festival.\" The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of the weather god Adad and of Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.  \n\nAre you an educator?

Whatever the age of the owner at her death, she was given a youthful countenance for the eternal afterlife. The shape of the face, with its long slender nose, sloe eyes, and sensuous mouth, identifies it as a product of the latter half of the Amarna period. The jar and lid were altered in antiquity, making it extremely difficult to identify the original owner.\n\nThe striking face carved on the jar lid represents one of the royal women of Amarna. Her hairstyle of overlapping curls, known as the Nubian wig, was worn only by adults and was popular among the female members of Akhenaten\u0027s family. The hole at the center of the forehead once secured the separately carved upper body of a rearing cobra whose tail is visible across the top of the wig. This royal protector was exclusively worn by kings and queens. Since its discovery in 1907, the face has been variously identified as that of Queen Tiye, Akhenaten\u0027s mother; Queen Nefertiti, his principal wife; Queen Kiya, his beloved secondary wife; and Princess Merytaten, his eldest daughter. For a time, it was even identified as Akhenaten himself. This confusion is understandable, since the inscription identifying the owner was almost completely erased. Faint traces of hieroglyphs indicate that the jar was originally inscribed for Kiya, and the Nubian wig is most frequently associated with this queen. In some respects, however, the face more closely resembles later representations of Tiye, and it is possible that the lid originally belonged to her burial equipment and was later placed on Kiya\u0027s canopic jar.\n\nThe tomb in which the jar was found, KV 55 in the Valley of the Kings, is probably the most controversial of all Egyptian tombs. It contained burial equipment inscribed for Queen Tiye and magical bricks with the name of Akhenaten. There were also four canopic jars (including this one) and an inlaid wooden coffin almost certainly made for Kiya. It appears that, for safekeeping, Tutankhamun had this material transferred to Thebes from Akhenaten\u0027s tomb at Amarna, which seems to have been plundered soon after Akhenaten\u0027s death. The jars and coffin of Kiya may have been reused at that time for the burial of another member of the royal family.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org. \n\nAre you an educator?

Back in New York, following his service in the army (ca. 1950–51), Johns became acquainted with artist Robert Rauschenberg, composer John Cage, and dancer Merce Cunningham. By the mid- to late 1950s Johns had already achieved fame with his paintings of targets, numerals, and American flags, and his work was exhibited in prominent museums and galleries in New York. \"White Flag\" of 1955, recently acquired by the Metropolitan from the artist\u0027s own collection, exemplifies Johns\u0027s early style, which engendered a wide range of subsequent art movements, among them Pop Art, Minimal Art, and Conceptual Art. During the 1950s and 1960s Johns frequently appropriated well-known images (such as targets, flags, and beer cans), elevating them to cultural icons. Throughout his oeuvre — which includes painting, prints, drawings, and sculpture — images are constantly recycled and combined in extensive series. In his later compositions of the 1970s, Johns filled the surface of his pictures with colorful cross-hatchings (suggested by the passing cars on an expressway); and since the 1980s he has incorporated images that have more autobiographical significance.\n\n\"White Flag\" is the largest of his flag paintings and the first in which the flag is presented in monochrome. By draining most of the color from the flag but leaving subtle gradations in tone, the artist shifts our attention from the familiarity of the image to the way in which it is made. \"White Flag\" is painted on three separate panels: the stars, the seven upper stripes to the right of the stars, and the longer stripes below. Johns worked on each panel separately. After applying a ground of unbleached beeswax, he built up the stars, the negative areas around them, and the stripes with applications of collage—cut or torn pieces of newsprint, other papers, and bits of fabric. He dipped these into molten beeswax and adhered them to the surface. He then joined the three panels and overpainted them with more beeswax mixed with pigments, adding touches of white oil.\n\nThe fast-setting medium of encaustic enabled Johns to make each brushstroke distinct, while the forty-eight-star flag design—contiguous with the perimeters of the canvas— provided a structure for the richly varied surface, which ranges from translucent to opaque.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"below-the-surface","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x876db2db","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/jsDARZEP0Ax137Qp-WeMX2w_e3IkHbu_jh6vyA07HScrRPp77wU_trgSXFZZPgCvc9coJi2UbGIJOhSxVlcTqV24","lastModified":1548921542334,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22520,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691010,"title":"Topic A: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 4th Grade, Module 6 Topic A","entryId":"4th-m6-ta-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/4th-grade-foundations-engageny/4th-m6-engage-ny-foundations#4th-m6-ta-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921616441,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22910,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691397,"title":"Helmschmid, Portions of a costume armor","description":"Met curator Pierre Terjanian on illusion in Kolman Helmschmid’s Portions of a costume armor, c. 1525.\n\nThis armor reproduces in steel the extravagant puffed and slashed costume of the German Landsknechte (mercenary infantry troops).

This saddle is distinguished by elaborate mounts of intricately modeled gilt copper set with turquoise. It was made in Derge (in present-day Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China), famous for centuries for its metalwork. It is rare and important as a fine example of high-quality, late Derge metalwork made for a known patron: the Tibetan nobleman Yuthok Tashi Dundrup (1906–1983) commissioned the saddle when he assumed the post of govornor of Eastern Tibet in 1942.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

The rim of the roundel, consisting of eighteen thumbnail-shaped cells for turquoise inlay in the manner of some Sarmatian roundels, frames the openwork figure of an eagle in high relief. Grasping a small, crouching animal in its talons, the bird perches in three-quarter view, facing right, with its chest extended and the rest of its body receding into the background. Its wings are outspread, the one on the left seen emerging from behind the swelling of the chest and the one on the right receding into the back plane. The body and legs carry ridges and linear patterning to suggest the texture of feathers. The bird\u0027s head is in profile, with a cell for the prominent ear, a protrusion at the eye area, a curved beak, and a downcurved line for the mouth. The entire figure is worked in the round, although the back is distorted and not as carefully finished as the front. The eagle\u0027s prey has been variously identified as an antelope, a goat, and a hare. Turquoise is inlaid in its large ear and in several places on its body. The tabs on either side of the roundel have cells for inlays at the corners in the form of debased acanthus leaves.\n\nThis piece is one of a pair; its mate, in the British Museum, London, depicts an eagle facing the opposite way. It was thought by Ernst Herzfeld to be part of a treasure found in 1910–11 in a chamber tomb near Nihavend in Iran. Herzfeld speculated that this trove had belonged to an aristocratic Parthian family and had originally included a group of Roman gold coins of the first to second century C.E. that surfaced independently in modern times. Another related piece of jewelry, found in excavations at Dalverzin Tepe in Iran, can be dated archaeologically to the first century C.E.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.  \n\nAre you an educator?

 Philosophers call arguments like these \"sound\".  You can see whether an argument is sound by trying to think of a counterexample to it, but to see whether its premises are true, you need to do some

In Peru, nose ornaments became less fashionable in the second half of the first millennium A.D. and were seldom used after about 600. This elegant, very delicate crescent nose ring from northern Peru is evidence of the high level of craftsmanship that existed among metalworkers at this time. Depicted are four spiders sitting in their web. The openwork, lacelike quality of the object was achieved by fusing the many minute parts together to create a symmetrical composition. The stylized spiders, their tiny eyes and fangs showing, are held, each in its own open space, by paired, spindly legs echoing the round bodies and joined to the web. Spider imagery occurs in Peruvian art from the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. onward, suggesting that spiders played a role in early Andean mythology. The spiders\u0027 ability to catch and kill live prey associates them with sacrifice. Information from the sixteenth-century Inka peoples links spiders with rainfall and fertility.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

He began his design career in the 1930s. It peaked between the late 1940s and mid- 1950s, when his scarce and highly original gowns were sought after by society\u0027s most prominent women. Personally draping and constructing the garments that bear his label, he is considered to be the only American to work in the true couture tradition. James saw himself as an artist and sculptor of dress rather than a dressmaker. He manipulated fabrics into dramatic shapes using complex seaming and sometimes complicated understructures to create his singular vision of timeless elegance. A master of the relationship between form, color and texture, he often heightened the drama of his evening wear by combining several like fabrics of different colors, or different fabrics in like colors but with different light reflective qualities. Also a perfectionist, he worked for years on refining certain seam lines, shapes and constructs that particularly expressed his vision of artistry through rigorous engineering. Many of his pieces are conceived asymmetrically and possess a sense of movement and vitality that is a signature characteristic of his work. Many historical references in shapes and construction, especially the drapery forms of the 1870s and early teens, are also prevalent throughout his work.\n\nThe construction of this dress reconfigures the body by having the harder draped fabric brought forward and soft fabric at the back, the opposite from the norm, giving the appearance of front and back being reversed. The startling color contrast and different reflective qualities of satin, wool-backed crepe and faille in the skirt reinforce this deception. The form of the hips bears witness to James\u0027 claims of being a sculptor of fabric.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n","entryId":"hipster","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xdf4d4d05","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/D3D47UkrtP2kyRdK2xTim8nMCLH1ZbKuBltWL5DGhYppW1fwSxOS9zDHdJ9qOSXaiNPp1fe6RxRA4Xrx8IMbP6A","lastModified":1548921547645,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22549,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691370,"title":"Documenting Conflict","description":"By its very nature, art is a kind of documentation—it reflects the society in which it was made, and the intention of the artist who created it.

Because they can bear witness to and capture life very nearly as we see it, photography has a unique relationship to reality among the arts. This can be seen in the evolution of photography from pure reportage to more creative forms of documentation. While the photographs in this exhibition serve to document and give proof to instances of conflict, very rarely do they show it explicitly: in some photos there isn’t a single weapon, just the faces of those who served as witnesses to a trauma. By showing what no longer is there, they document and immortalize the effects of violence on the landscape, human body, and psyche, from shell-shocked soldiers in Vietnam to empty fields in Flanders.\n\nPhotographs have the power to document, to capture images and the lingering effects of events on places and people.

He was one of many German exiles, including a significant number of artists, who were interned in a camp on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. During his time in the camp and for many years later, Schwitters made hundreds of portraits in an effort to earn a living and document the lives and faces of those not on the front line.\n\nAfter his release in 1941 he became closely involved with the London art scene, and continued to make portraits of those around him. Take a look at how Schwitters captured the effects of conflict on those beyond the field of battle.

masterpieces, this table (ca. 1761–63) was made for his frequent and most important client, Madame de Pompadour. The main charge of her coat of arms, a tower, appears at the top of the gilt-bronze mount at each corner. The marquetry of the top—one of the finest panels in all of Oeben\u0027s furniture—was designed to reflect her interests in the arts and depicts a vase of flowers as well as trophies emblematic of architecture, painting, music, and gardening. The table, completed after Oeben\u0027s death by his brother-in-law Roger Vandercruse, demonstrates Oeben\u0027s talents, not only as a creator of beautiful furniture but also as a mechanic: an elaborate mechanism allows the top to slide back at the same time as the larger drawer moves forward, thereby doubling the surface area.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

In doing so, these photographs go beyond documentary and begin to speak not only to each other, but to their viewers in new and thought-provoking ways.

Restorations by the eighteenth-century Italian sculptor Vincenzo Pacetti: (on Dionysos) ivy wreath, neck, both arms, lower right leg, calf and boot of left leg, hanging drapery on right side; (on the archaistic image) uplifted corner of drapery, both arms, lower half of lower legs, feet, pedestal, entire base.\n\nDionysos, god of wine and divine intoxication, wears a panther skin over his short chiton and his high sandals with animal heads on the overhanging skin flaps. He stands beside an archaistic female image whose pose and dress imitate those of Greek statues carved in the sixth century B.C.E. It is difficult to know whether the original Greek bronze statue of Dionysos, of which this is a copy, included the female figure. Supports in the form of pillars, herms, and small statues were not uncommon in Classical art, but this figure may have been added to support the outstretched arm and may represent Spes, a Roman personification of Hope, who was commonly shown as an archaistic maiden.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

An example: there are way more real numbers than there are natural numbers.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Agustín Rayo, Professor of Philosophy, MIT","entryId":"sizes-of-infinity-part-2-getting-real","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x684844b0","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/4xDGfLeO6tirDunHNXXPTmpdn7DAK4IgiS5Ok7c2TOuz8VCw-OwKe-kv_dstqtxcpOjLHVawAWSyuIkQz1ZOizZt","lastModified":1548921559244,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22613,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691343,"title":"Lily van der Stokker\u0027s \"non-shouting feminism\"","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nBright, chirpy, and colourful images adorn the walls of Lily van der Stokker’s exhibition No Big Deal Thing at Tate St Ives. The Dutch artist, based in Amsterdam and New York, produces elaborate and decorative wall drawings that deal with seemingly banal events like paying bills, cleaning, cooking: the stuff of everyday life. Executing her drawings in a childlike and almost naïve manner, van der Stokker also makes use of pattern, decoration, furniture, and the tools of domestic space.\nMerging feminism, conceptual art and pop art, van der Stokker describes her practice as “non-shouting feminism.” Are her drawings really so childish and naïve? Or do you think the artist is bringing these quiet, domestic elements into the gallery to make a statement about what belongs there?\n","entryId":"lily-van-der-stokker","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x35d9139e","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/dLt-DhWRhg0Cvx77xZcP1CmG6FCuF0l7nIPOzVfmTP51aNhasdEcigSCCaLCqwJPLUHt9WJ699reYbNTNx1d5o1S","lastModified":1548921552961,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22577,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691342,"title":"Justification and Explanation","description":"Test your knowledge of justification and explanation.","entryId":"justification-vs-explanation","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xbe794a9c","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/BeOgMWy4wbB_Q_hya2R5VB6kM67lVZt4Kk7QK0qeQF8kNTAZdgQySmtM2CjlKCnM43zq5iJ325T-aH9yhE89dd4","lastModified":1548921553000,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22578,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691341,"title":"Mounted police and crowd control at Tate Modern","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nIn artist Tania Bruguera’s 2007 performance Tatlin’s Whisper #5, unwitting gallery-goers are confronted by mounted police who ride back and forth throughout the gallery space, corralling people and controlling their movements. Visitors who expect to walk freely through the museum are presented instead with a controlled and threatening environment. In this video, the Cuban artist talks about her performance work and explains why, instead of presenting images that can be viewed at a safe distance, she wants people to personally experience the dynamics of power. Performance art has the unique power of being able to activate viewers and invite them to become part of the artwork, giving them a sense of power they might not otherwise experience in a gallery setting. But in this case Bruguera has turned performance art on its head, and instead of empowering her audience she intentionally makes them feel disempowered.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat purpose do you think Bruguera’s performance serves? Is it okay for police to corral and give orders to an audience, whether they like it or not? Do you think an experience like this gives the visitor an opportunity to think about and question the idea of state power without facing real consequences?\n","entryId":"tania-bruguera-crowd-control","author":"","publisher":"Khan

An acclaimed pioneer of queer cinema, her prolific output includes the earliest avant-garde films that openly address lesbian life and sexuality. Using her own body, Hammer explores the nature of film itself, appearing to push at the edges of the frame in an effort to push cinema from the its typical rectangular form to something new–like the circle. With this new circular form, Hammer takes film off the screen and projects it into the space an audience is in, making it necessary to move to view the film.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to pushing the boundaries of film, Hammer has pushed for acceptance of the female body and sexuality, and a break from artifice and disguise.

Silver stamps dating to 613–29/30 on the reverse of these masterpieces place their manufacture in Herakleios’s reign. The biblical figures on the plates wear the costume of the early Byzantine court, suggesting to the viewer that, like Saul and David, the Byzantine emperor was a ruler chosen by God. Elaborate dishes used for display at banquets were common in the late Roman and early Byzantine world; generally decorated with classical themes, these objects conveyed wealth, social status, and learning. This set of silver plates may be the earliest surviving example of the use of biblical scenes for such displays. Their intended arrangement may have closely followed the biblical order of the events, and their display may have conformed to the shape of a Christogram, or monogram for the name of Christ. At the top of this magnificent plate, David confronts Goliath, and between them is a personification of the river from which David gathered stones for his sling. The major scene shows the decisive battle. Although David appears to be on the defensive, his men move forward, forcing Goliath’s soldiers into retreat. At the bottom, the victorious David beheads the giant (1 Samuel 17:41–51).\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

How do you balance clarity with enough emotion with sufficient creative space?\" In another performance by Cuban artist Tania Bruguera, we are confronted with questions about immigration, nationalism, and what it means to be a citizen of the world. After lining up to visit the exhibition, some visitors are required to pass an “immigration test” and a polygraph test before being granted access to the inner gallery. Once inside, the darkened space is lit only by the sparks of a migrant worker welding a sign. The sign reads “Arbeit Macht Frei” (“work makes you free”)–the very same words that hung over the entrance to the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.\nIn this case the gallery provides a more secluded space in which to confront and contemplate issues of discrimination and nationalism. What do you think Bruguera is trying to say with this piece?\n\nClick here to learn more about Tania Bruguera and how she engages with performace, interdisciplinary practice, and activism. \n","entryId":"tania-bruguera-the-tanks","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x644f0948","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/PfBapmW0I27gdnZdVRloDaW1AgEZQAK-G0mDpd_Kq1OEN-LMidxqHZMXT-gL2-sCE-4fvX5PgIwAEOmIy7eUfp7Dww","lastModified":1548921554223,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22583,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691335,"title":"Keren Cytter: Radical gender reversals and theatrical performance","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nWhat if you woke up one morning as the opposite sex?

The focal point of the painting is the tragic death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza. Abandoned by his fleeing troops, he charged the attacking column alone, fell mortally wounded, and, refusing all assistance, died near his post. Trumbull portrays him rejecting the aid of General George Eliott, commander of the British troops. This work, the largest and last of three versions of the subject that Trumbull executed between 1786 and 1789, demonstrates his ambition to solidify his reputation on the basis of the highly respected genre of history painting.\n\nView this work on metmuseum.org.\n\nAre you an educator?

Employing archival footage, voice-overs, re-enactments and found photographs, Narkevicius\u0027s films reinterpret historical events by placing them in different narrative structures, such as memoir, documentary, and drama.\nNarkevicius believes that stories and novels can be “more authentic” than historical documents. What do you think he means by this? More authentic in what way?\n","entryId":"deimantas-narkevicius","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xf95dbc11","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/aQWHlrL9pHWqiUsLlaa9jUN-QdqB4-qDqh8lgLeoNaUhUIcLdpA0U74PXMPMOcVN5cLM95XF0cw1pPLh-3kpqqo","lastModified":1548921556998,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22600,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691317,"title":"Metaphysics: Problem of Free Will","description":"Richard discusses one of the classic philosophical problem of free will --- that is, the question of whether we decide things for ourselves, or are forced to go one way or another.

One worry is that the laws of physics, plus facts about the past over which we have no control, determine what we will do, and that means we’re not free. Another worry is that because the laws and the past determine what we’ll do, someone smart enough could know what we would do ahead of time, so we can’t be free. He says the second worry is much worse than the first, but argues that the second doesn’t follow from the first.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Richard Holton, Professor of Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology","entryId":"problem-of-free-will","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x2e1e1e2c","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/36l9K7R3IBYLqHCwcp-NCd1La05_eMpJL6jyxJFXVUw-6BbBZ1vc_c8Pqh6tWBCwgL2_UQgZ4mA2p6MX4UFHbYPB","lastModified":1548921557460,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22603,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691315,"title":"Fundamentals: Correlation and Causation","description":"In this Wireless Philosophy video, Paul Henne (Duke University) explains the difference between correlation and causation.","entryId":"critical-thinking-fundamentals-correlation-and-causation","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x64326d3b9fe16849","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/n-OY50k8AVEHP4puekAQ5H9fVT0MLq-hqsxCsNI4An1fiPob2xkkpYmlj6Un-bDNfe1eMPPW0rEwnmFNiV8L746PpA","lastModified":1548921557997,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22604,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691316,"title":"Key Points","description":"","entryId":"creating-contradiction-key-points","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xad4d0dcb","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/K5bzbA067FpSFjs7VuTCAEosuCGLm4NfxQbq_tYtpMHIyB5j-nirP_Pdy8XXrmoARE3_2TBnGafYaRTsSiFt4iw","lastModified":1548921557908,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22604,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691311,"title":"Ethics: The Problem of Evil","description":"Sally discusses a classic argument that God does not exist, called \u0027The Problem of Evil\u0027.

Pop art is a movement that emerged in the 1950s -- in America, Britain, and around the world -- as a revolution against the dominant approaches to art and culture at the time. Seeing the traditional artistic methods, subjects, and media still dominant in art schools and museums, many young artists grew keenly aware of the disconnect between these established practices and the popular culture that defined their everyday lives. So they turned away from tradition and looked to Hollywood movies, advertising, product packaging, pop music and comic books for their source material, creating a movement that both celebrated and critiqued the consumer culture they lived in. Join actor Alan Cumming as he whips through the history of pop art in America and Britain, from Andy Warhol to Peter Blake.\n\nCan a can of soup be a work of art?

In the 1960s, he broke with the established traditions of abstract expressionism, choosing instead to create paintings that mimicked the the techniques of printed materials (such as the famous Ben-Day dots) and drawing on popular imagery from comic strips, advertisements, and other printed sources. Lichtenstein makes us think about the paradox of being an artist -- someone who we often think of using their hands to make something -- in an age of mechanically produced and printed images. This mass production of images challenged not only the tradition of hand-painting but also the perceived originality of painters at the time, so Lichtenstein created work that both drew on and parodied popular imagery. Take a look back in time at Lichtenstein’s legacy through a few of his key paintings, like Whaaam (1963).\n\nLichtenstein once said: \"The things I have parodied, I really admire.\" How could that be?

He even pre-dates some of his pop art colleagues, having worked with comic book images before Lichtenstein, and with sculptures of consumer goods even before Warhol.\n\nBlake says that he sees his studio as a museum, and that \"the act of collecting is a conceptual art form.\" When does a collection become a work of art? Can curating and arranging a group of objects be considered an artwork?","entryId":"peter-blake-studio","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x5a83afa0","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZCdwTudJg6e6n-P2gsaUborP4izvMsGo71pvEVlX9dNYWcLXcP7VHkWpn2grt4TUP1KoJLQP9NswyHBuBLSFTBw","lastModified":1548921564146,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22646,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691270,"title":"Ethics: Utilitarianism, Part 2","description":"Julia Markovits (Cornell University) gives an introduction to the moral theory of utilitarianism.

Polke was one of the most significant German artists to emerge in the 1960s, making art in parallel to more \"mainstream\" Pop in a huge range of materials from painting, drawing and film to potatoes, bubble wrap, and arsenic-based paints. As a young man and self-professed member of a group called the Capitalist Realists, Polke created work that responded to the beginnings of consumer society and popular imagery in West Germany, painting objects like socks, shirts, and plastic tubs in vibrant colours. In the early \u002760s, Polke worked with halftone images – a printing technique using series of dots, not unlike Lichtenstein\u0027s Ben-Day dots – taken from newspapers and other popular printed matter. He later shifted to overlaying images, working with larger canvases, and making use of more unconventional materials. Through his work, Polke confronted difficult truths about the world he lived in – such as Nazism and the Berlin Wall – including those of a consumer, image-driven society.\n\nWhat do you think makes Pop art in Germany so different from more mainstream understandings of Pop, like in the US and UK?

Since the mid-1960s, her work has been exemplary of what she calls the \"other pops\", or the engagements with pop art and the ideals of the movement that were thriving beyond the US and UK at the time. Her work often sought a prominent role for women, using it as a language to reflect on what the role of women in society was in the \u002760s. Influenced by the socio-political upheavals of the time, her practice is mainly based around functional, everyday objects, like sculptures that have been made into chests of drawers. Her work Red Coat (1969) was created for improvised performances in public spaces, and presents the human body as a conceptual piece of art. Stripping its wearers of any particular identity, it immerses them in a communal performance of equality. \n\nIn this film, take a trip around the world with Nicola L\u0027s Red Coat. Do you think that Red Coat can be a work of art on its own, or does it need to be animated with people inside of it to be art? When does a body become a work of art?\n","entryId":"nicola-l","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x300c8253","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/ZCdwTudJg6e6n-P2gsaUborP4izvMsGo71pvEVlX9dNYWcLXcP7VHkWpn2grt4TUP1KoJLQP9NswyHBuBLSFTBw","lastModified":1548921566354,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22660,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691259,"title":"Ethics: The Problem of Moral Luck","description":"Victor Kumar (Michigan) introduces the problem of moral luck and surveys potential solutions.

In the 1960s, Saint Phalle emerged as a powerful and original figure in a highly masculine international Pop arts world. She began with highly decorative, colourful paintings before moving on to creative assemblages and landscapes using objects found throughout the household, such as toys, broken plates, and kitchen gloves. Look closely at her Self Portrait (1958), a dark and visibly tortured depiction, and you\u0027ll see that her own figure is made up of shards of glass and household trinkets. Like Nicola L and other female Pop artists around the world, Saint Phalle used her work to explore the roles of women in art in society, through pieces such as Shooting Pictures, in which she fired a .22 rifle into bags of paint strapped to a canvas, and the \"Nanas\", her bold and colourful sculptures of monstrously feminine figures.\n\nWe\u0027ve seen that Pop art was a vehicle for international and women artists to disrupt an art history that they saw as belonging to mostly male artists in a US-UK context.

Aristotle reasoned that just as artificial things (such as tools and workers) have characteristic capabilities with respect to which they are judged to be good or do well, so each kind of natural thing (including plants and humans) has characteristic capabilities with respect to which can be judged, objectively, to be good or do well. For plants and animals these mostly have to do with nutrition and reproduction, and in the case of animals, pleasure and pain. For humans, these vegetative and animal capabilities are necessary but not sufficient for our flourishing. Since reason and the use of language are the unique and highest capabilities of humans, the cultivation and exercise of intellectual friendships and partnerships, moral and political virtue, scientific knowledge and (above all) theoretical philosophy, was argued by Aristotle to be the ultimate purpose of human life.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Monte Ransome Johnson,  Associate Professor, University of California San Diego","entryId":"aristotle-on-the-purpose-of-life","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x8a0d99ca","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/vBLNe5Cvc6GJZGoMZsJw8oTouqRDBiNsIOl31JUFRQzFCewtTAxRrxFdm1Ua1qoMP5Fvtmmtuq3xQ1PcWjlacpPu","lastModified":1548921580576,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22755,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691164,"title":"Epistemology: The Value of Knowledge","description":"People tend to value knowledge; it’s better to know something than just to believe it, even if your belief is correct by pure luck.

Despite society’s view at the time that he was on the edge of senility–it is said that Queen Victoria thought him quite mad–Turner still travelled extensively. He witnessed new cultures and social scenes, exhibited a supreme confidence in his tools, and created work that was so different from that of his contemporaries that they often didn’t know what to make of it.\nSome historians believe that the abstract qualities of late Turner made him a very early precursor to Modernism. Despite creating dramatic new textures and visual experiences, Turner synthesised his earlier experiences without abandoning the interests and methods of his past.

Never before has it been so easy to get a handle on Kant\u0027s views on space!\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Scott Edgar, Assistant Professor, Saint Mary\u0027s University\n\n \n","entryId":"kant-on-space-part-1","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xf7deb347","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Wd3VR9fRuAb9t38FQuUxFEwaO8TtGdGIcwDOWYNpWGYenmeI6T8IDZQzWz6ZBZZ9TAjhtT98mKjhtW16BMmH7C0Q","lastModified":1548921588299,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22810,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691109,"title":"Room: 2000s and beyond","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nCurator Helen Little explores art in the new millennium.\n\nLearn more about the art featured in this video:\n- Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, 10pm Saturday, 2012\n- Richard Wright, Untitled Figure 1, 2002","entryId":"room-2000","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x93b5740c","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Dkph0leWVxxwvjrN5hCfjQCnQszUQ67FRQXvVe4PX8VEgLiKhP9R_t-2ORJX3Ta9031dBwyBpJRq7cQ0V8DDR1UMCQ","lastModified":1548921588393,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22811,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691108,"title":"Metaphilosophy: Contrastivism #3 (Causation)","description":"In this Wireless Philosophy video, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (Duke University) introduces a new approach to causation: contrastivism.

The juke boxes were filled with sound material including clips of artists speaking about their work, lectures by curators, personal letters from artists like Paul Nash, and music inspired by the art in the gallery.

Sutherland’s sketchbooks are essential to understanding the artist’s practice: they are rough, paint-spattered, and covered in marks, giving us a glimpse into Sutherland’s hands-on approach to planning and creating a painting.\nSeeing an actual work of art is one thing, but what benefits could there be to preserving art digitally? Does it allow for us to interact with art in ways we might never be able to handle the original? Is it a useful tool for people who can’t physically come to a museum or gallery?\n\nClick here to leaf through Sutherland’s sketchbooks in the Tate archives.\n","entryId":"graham-sutherland-sketchbooks","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x31c9f420","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/pwD5-w2wdQsKr4GgzbONjJ-7h4QuXf-vbb6GaxsuuN5XGIT_h9Krpb5BS_TuAKyfSNyiQOmAc3XY5NZco3npaT5_","lastModified":1548921594621,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22847,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691072,"title":"Collaboration","description":"With its synergetic and cooperative spirit, performance art can be a call for artists to work with one another.

Among the many in the Hutchinson internment camp was German painter and sculptor Kurt Schwitters, who continued to work despite facing difficult conditions and a lack of materials. Bolstered by the strong artistic and intellectual community that developed within the camp, Schwitters continued to paint, sculpt, and craft using materials as diverse as old wood from a piano, vinyl, and even porridge! Artistic exhibitions and even a theatre were developed in the camp, and the imprisoned artistic community flourished. By chance, art historian Klaus Hinrichsen was interned with Schwitters, and as such he produced a careful series of documents that captured their time–and Schwitters’ work–in the internment camp.\nBy a very lucky twist of fate, Schwitters was interned with not only a community of fellow artists but also a master archivist in the form of Hinrichsen, who made sure to preserve Schwitters’ work and process. This fortuitous archive remains as a testament to what artists can produce even if in confinement. Can you think of any other artists that produced great work in the face of difficulty?\n\nSee more of Kurt Schwitters\u0027 work in the Tate collection here.\n\n\n","entryId":"schwitters-interned","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://xd0aadb9d","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/jms8voLajiN362r8Bdrbom7Zh93KC-OBEZVrB-HfWnwPCp61OSgVxKd27UW8GYXZ6_cieakn7B7QC05nFEXB1bHV","lastModified":1548921596384,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22856,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691063,"title":"Daido Moriyama","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nPrinting Show is a recreation of Daido Moriyama\u0027s 1974 performance of the same name.

Can art help us explore the fickle nature of what we remember, and how?","entryId":"art-and-memory","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/arts-humanities-partners/tate/archives-memory#art-and-memory","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921597959,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22865,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691054,"title":"Participation","description":"Performance art is more than a prompt for its audience to consider and question art–it\u0027s often an invitation for the audience to get involved.

Over three years, Landy catalogued each and every one of his worldly possessions and then systematically destroyed them in front of an audience. He draws in inspiration from the work of Swiss painter and sculpture Jean Tinguely, whose 1960 Homage to New York was a great sculptural machine designed to destroy itself and leave nothing behind as a record. Although Tinguely’s piece failed to self-destruct and was prematurely shut down by the fire brigade, it left behind an idea that Landy took up in his own work, decades later.\nWhat’s the point of a self-destructing work of art? Is the work in the object itself, or in the performance around it? And in a world in which everything can be documented in images and videos, can a work of art every really erase itself from memory?\n","entryId":"michael-landy","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x791c0ed0","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/4dEZTJJshub7Sg2HGOZrm86IkA7ChX3LMta7BaNS6i1yPg-_w53JGNCs2VgqVAV1UFOjHCaVMRiIcMD9hIZHUj4","lastModified":1548921598775,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22870,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691048,"title":"Topic A: Foundations","description":"Foundational material to help you prepare for Eureka Math/EngageNY 3rd Grade, Module 2 Topic A","entryId":"3rd-m2-ta-foundations","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/topic-foundations-engageny/3rd-grade-foundations-engageny/3rd-m2-engage-ny-foundations#3rd-m2-ta-foundations","thumbnailUrl":"","lastModified":1548921598829,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22870,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691049,"title":"Quiz: Fashion meets art","description":"Test your knowledge of terms and materials in the \"Fashion meets art\" tutorial.","entryId":"quiz-fashion-meets-art","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x81d3190a","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/BeOgMWy4wbB_Q_hya2R5VB6kM67lVZt4Kk7QK0qeQF8kNTAZdgQySmtM2CjlKCnM43zq5iJ325T-aH9yhE89dd4","lastModified":1548921598847,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":22870,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533691047,"title":"Thomas Hirschhorn: Flamme Éternelle","description":"This video brought to you by Tate.org.uk\n\nWatch as artist Thomas Hirschhorn stages his participatory artwork Flamme Éternelle at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris.
