 <h3>
  Reading the sounds of single letters
 </h3>
 <p>
  We use sounds when we speak, listen and read. The sound of the letter is called ‘phonic’. When a child is learning to read using the phonics method (hanyar ilimin sauti), she/he learns to say the sound of each letter and joins these sounds to form words as he/she reads. The letters of the alphabet are usually known by their names. For example, Aa is called ‘aei’; Tt is called ‘tee’ Mm is called ‘em’ and Xx is called ‘ex’. But when these letters sit in a word, they are not pronounced by their name but by their sound. These sounds are called letter sounds or phonics. For example, in a word Aa will be said as /a/ Tt is /t/, Mm is /m/ and Xx is /ks/ so ‘mix’ becomes /m-i-ks/ (miks)’.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  When we teach pupils how to read, we write the letter sounds on flash cards so that the pupils can see one sound at a time and learn each sound separately. This way the pupil is able to connect the sounds to the alphabet letters which they represent. In this section you learn to practise the sounds with your pupils and show them how to join these sounds when they read words.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Before we move to the next part of this section, do you know how to pronounce the letter sounds of the English alphabet correctly? Watch the video clips EM3V0a – EM3VOd to hear the sounds of letters and practise with the speaker.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Think
 </h3>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="84" src="exe-files/user-added/tdp-think.png" style="float: left;" width="49"/>
  1. Did you know about letter names and letter sounds before? What
  <br/>
  are the differences between the two?
  <br/>
  2. What resources or activities have you used to teach letters and
  <br/>
  sounds? Give at least one example for each.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Watch
 </h3>
 <p>
  <video controls="controls" height="150" width="300">
   <source src="exe-files/user-added/EM3V1-3g.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </source>
  </video>
 </p>
 <p>
  Watch the video clip. As you watch think about the following questions:
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  1) What resources does the teacher use to teach pupils how to pronounce letter sounds?
  <br/>
  2) How does the teacher help the pupils to learn the sounds? Choose your answer from the following:
  <br/>
  a) She shows the real objects (abubuwa) and says the sounds several times, then ask the pupils to say the sounds
  <br/>
  b) She shows the real objects, asks pupils to say the sounds and corrects them if they are wrong
  <br/>
  c) She shows the real objects and sings the sounds to help pupils learn them
  <br/>
  3)What do pupils have to find in the story on the chalkboard?
 </p>
 <h3>
  Reflect
 </h3>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="64" src="exe-files/user-added/tdp-reflect.png" style="float: left;" width="46"/>
  In the video you just saw, can you find three things that the teacher did differently than what you do in your classroom to teach letter sounds? How do you think it helped or didn’t help the teacher? Write your thoughts (tunani) in your journal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  In the next page, there is a table listing what two teachers and their pupils do in two different classes. Compare (kamanta) the two lessons – Class A and Class B. In one class, the pupils practise saying the letter sounds more than in the other class. Which class is this – Class A or Class B? Then answer the following questions about these lessons:
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  1) In which lesson is the teacher doing most of the work?
  <br/>
  2) Which pupils practise the letter sounds more – pupils in class A or B? How?
  <br/>
  3) Which lesson do you like best? Why?

 <h3>
  Work with your partner
 </h3>
 <p>
  <img alt="" height="43" src="exe-files/user-added/tdp-partner.png" style="float: left;" width="46"/>
  - Listen to the video clip on letter sounds with your partner and
  <br/>
  practise the sounds
  <br/>
  - Play the following letter and sound game with your partner:
  <br/>
  1. Take a piece of paper. Write your partner’s name on it. Make a list of numbers from 1-10. This will be your partner’s result sheet.
  <br/>
  2. Look at the chart given. Point to any letter and ask your partner to say the sound of the letter within two seconds.

  3. If your partner can say the sound correctly within two seconds, write “+” on the result sheet. If your partner fails to say the sound within two seconds or says it incorrectly, put a “-” on the result sheet.
  <br/>
  4. Play this game in turns. You pick one letter and ask your partner to say the sound. After that, your partner picks another letter sound from the chart. Play this game until all the letters are completed from the chart.
  <br/>
  5. When you have finished, count how many “+” and “-” you have got. Whoever gets the most ‘+’ is the winner!
  <br/>
  6. You can also play this game with your pupils in class.
